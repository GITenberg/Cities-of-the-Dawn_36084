THE AUTHOR</p>
<h2><a name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xi</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>In this new publication, consisting chiefly of articles which
appeared in the <i>Christian World</i>, the <i>Echo</i>, and the
<i>East Anglian Daily Times</i>, the author makes no pretence to
original information, or to have acted the part of an antiquarian
explorer.&nbsp; He has simply gone over ground familiar to many,
and to which all holiday-makers will turn in increasing numbers,
partly for pleasure, and partly on account of the absorbing
interest attaching to the route here briefly described.&nbsp; To
such he offers his services as guide, philosopher and friend,
trusting also that many who stay at home may be interested in the
story here told.</p>
<p>With regard to the illustrations, the author acknowledges the
kindness of Dr. Lunn and Messrs. Cassell in allowing him the use
of them, and especially is grateful to Miss Pollard, the daughter
of the author of that valuable work, &lsquo;The Land of the
Monuments,&rsquo; for permission to use her sketch &lsquo;Dawn on
the Great Sphinx,&rsquo; which he has utilized for his
frontispiece.</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">A RUN ACROSS FRANCE.</p>
<p>To leave London one day and to arrive in Marseilles the next
would have been deemed impossible&mdash;the dream of a
madman&mdash;in the age in which I was born, when steamships and
railways were unknown.&nbsp; Yet it is a fact, to the truth of
which I can testify.&nbsp; Half a century has elapsed since the
fair fields, leafy woodlands, and breezy chalk downs of Kent were
invaded by a band of navvies, who, under the skilful direction of
the late Sir William Cubitt, built up the main line of the
South-Eastern Railway.&nbsp; The next thing was to connect France
and Europe, which was done by means of steamers running between
Calais and Dover, and thence by rail to all the chief Continental
cities and health resorts.</p>
<p>I leave London by the Continental express at eight in the
morning one cold day in October; in eight hours I am in Paris,
passing Calais and Abbeville, both of which places, especially
the former, are, I believe, pretty well known in these days of
universal restlessness and travel.&nbsp; It is little we see <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>of Paris, the
gay and beautiful.&nbsp; We have to dine&mdash;for man must dine,
if possible, once a day&mdash;and to Paris we turn for its cooks
and cookery.&nbsp; It is there that the art of dining is carried
to perfection.&nbsp; &lsquo;Unquiet meals make ill
digestions.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is no fear of that as I sit down
to my well-prepared repast at the handsome buffet attached to the
French Northern Railway, and yet there my troubles begin.&nbsp;
As a barbarous Englander, I ask why in Paris, the centre, as it
deems itself, of civilization and refinement, I am compelled to
help myself to salt by putting my knife into the
saltcellar.&nbsp; Then, again, it seems curious to me, and what I
am not accustomed to, to eat my fish without a fitting knife and
fork.&nbsp; Surely one may expect to find in Paris the refinement
one is accustomed to in one&rsquo;s native land!&nbsp; As to
being cheated with one&rsquo;s eyes open, one does not
complain&mdash;you expect it, and it is not worth while losing
your temper merely for the sake of a few paltry centimes; and yet
I felt that I had been done unfairly when, on asking a waiter for
a cup of coffee <i>noir</i>, and giving him an English shilling,
and particularly calling his attention to the value of the coin,
he coolly treats it as a franc, and gives me change
accordingly.&nbsp; That was rather a dear cup of coffee, I
calculate; but, then, the fault was mine, and mine alone.&nbsp; I
ought to have provided myself with French money before I
started.</p>
<p>I am going on what Dr. Lunn calls an educational tour on the
Continent.&nbsp; It seems to me I shall get a good deal of
education of some kind or other before I return to my native land
again.&nbsp; There are about 112 on board from London and the
provinces.&nbsp; As we are bound for Jerusalem, we have, as was
to be expected, <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>a large proportion of the clerical element.&nbsp; Ladies
are not so numerous as one would expect from what one knows of
the curiosity and fondness for adventure of lovely woman.&nbsp;
The worst part of the trip is the long, wearying ride from Paris
to Marseilles, where we found peace and plenty on board the
<i>Midnight Sun</i>.&nbsp; We saw but little of the country on
leaving Paris; but when we reached Lyons, where we were refreshed
with delicious coffee and bread-and-butter, and were provided
with a handsome lunch, to be eaten in the course of our journey,
consisting of a bottle of claret, beef and fowl,
bread-and-butter, and cheese and fruit&mdash;a handsome meal, to
which we all did justice&mdash;the day broke on us clear and
fine.</p>
<p>But I pause to make another little grumble.&nbsp; In barbarous
England the lunch would have been neatly packed away in a basket
specially provided for the purpose, and a knife and fork would
have been included.&nbsp; On the Lyons railway a brown paper bag
was deemed all that was necessary, and instead of a knife and
fork we had to use our fingers.&nbsp; As there was no convenience
for washing&mdash;at any rate, as regards second-class
passengers, <i>quorum pars fui</i>; I recommend the traveller to
go first-class on such a long ride&mdash;you can imagine our
disgusting state.&nbsp; It seems to me that the rule that they do
things better in France is one to which there are several
exceptions.&nbsp; But in some respects France beats us.&nbsp; It
will be hard to find anywhere in England a prettier ride than
that we enjoyed from Lyons to Marseilles.&nbsp; The white houses,
with their green blinds and red tiles, nestling in and among the
trees, always make a French landscape bright and gay.&nbsp; Their
great industrial and manufacturing centres also always <a

cleaner and less forbidding in their dreariness than ours at
home; and if the little narrow plots you see suggest peasant
farming, rather than the high and costly farming patronized at
home, you feel that the peasant of gay and sunny France&mdash;for
such France undoubtedly is&mdash;has a happier lot than with
us.&nbsp; But as you travel you have no time to think of such
things.&nbsp; It is all one can do to watch the fairy panorama of
rock and river, of waving woods and smiling plains, as you glide
by.&nbsp; At all times the Loire is a grand river, but to-day it
is flooded, and seems to be made up of lakes and seas, in which
struggle haystacks, farmhouses, barns, the everlasting poplars,
and, what is worse, the poor man&rsquo;s garden, and I think, in
one or two cases that met my pitying eye, his vinefields as
well.</p>
<p>One word before I have done with the <i>Midnight
Sun</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;In the new yachting,&rsquo; writes Sir
Morell Mackenzie, &lsquo;there is no unpleasantness as to the
change of places to be visited, nor are carefully-arranged plans
to be disarranged at the last moment by the thoughtlessness or
unpunctuality of friends.&nbsp; You have the pleasure of
companionship, without any of the responsibilities of a host or
the obligations of a guest.&nbsp; You can enjoy the sea and the
air charged with ozone, which is the champagne of the lungs, and
free from any taint of animal or vegetable corruption, just as
freely as if you were an Alexander Selkirk on a floating island;
and you have many comforts which cannot be had even on the
largest and best-appointed yachts.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such were the
results of the great physician&rsquo;s experience on board one of
the fine excursion steamers of the Orient line.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
felt,&rsquo; he writes, &lsquo;like Faust after his great
transformation scene from age to youth.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>I am not
on an Orient steamer, but I am on the <i>Midnight Sun</i>, and to
that Sir Morell Mackenzie&rsquo;s testimony is equally
applicable.&nbsp; The <i>Midnight Sun</i> is a grand steamer of
3,178 tons, and she was especially fitted out for yachting
purposes.&nbsp; She may be said to be the best of the
class.&nbsp; For instance, take the sleeping cabins.&nbsp; They
contain no upper sleeping berths&mdash;a boon most acceptable to
passengers who have had to pass many nights, as I have done, in
cabins overcrowded with passengers and luggage.&nbsp; An idea of
the magnificent proportions of the <i>Midnight Sun</i> may be
gathered from the fact that seven times round her deck is equal
to one mile.&nbsp; The upper deck forms a promenade over the
entire length of the ship, with uninterrupted views on either
side.&nbsp; She has been engaged by Dr. Lunn for his co-operative
educational cruises, which become more popular every year.&nbsp;
I note especially the smoking-room on the upper deck, capable of
accommodating nearly 100 persons.&nbsp; There is a crew of 110 on
board for the purpose of ensuring our safety and supplying our
comforts and wants.&nbsp; Truly, if one cannot enjoy himself on
such a trip, and with such a company of gentlemen and ladies as
Dr. Lunn succeeds in drawing around him, he must be hard to
please.&nbsp; Dr. Lunn, who is not on board, is in himself a
host, and so is his popular brother, who supplies his
place.&nbsp; We are now approaching Corsica.&nbsp; I will spare
you my feelings as I gaze on the land that gave birth to a
Napoleon Bonaparte, and that sheltered Seneca in his dreary
exile, but which in modern times Lady Burdett Coutts finds to be
a very beneficial health resort.&nbsp; They are all that should
inspire the virtuous emotions of a true-born Englishman.</p>
<h2><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>CHAPTER
II.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">OFF TO NAPLES.</p>
<p>I left off my last letter opposite Corsica.&nbsp; Since
then&mdash;and this is the charm of coming to Naples in the
<i>Midnight Sun</i>&mdash;we have passed quite a cluster of isles
more or less renowned in history&mdash;such as Caprera, the rocky
home of the great Italian, Garibaldi&mdash;of which, alas! we see
nothing.&nbsp; In old times Caprera derived its name from the
wild goats, its original inhabitants.&nbsp; Later on it was
colonized by monks.&nbsp; &lsquo;The whole island,&rsquo; says a
contemporary writer quoted by Gibbon, &lsquo;is filled, or,
rather, defiled by men, who fly from the light.&nbsp; They call
themselves monks, or solitaries, because they choose to live
alone, without any witnesses of their actions.&nbsp; They fear
the gifts of fortune from the apprehension of losing them, and,
lest they should be miserable, they embrace a life of voluntary
wretchedness.&rsquo;&nbsp; Elba, however, is visible, which the
wiseacres whom Providence, for mysterious reasons of its own, at
one time permitted to rule over European affairs, fixed on as the
residence of the Corsican adventurer, in the childish belief that
he who had aimed almost at universal empire, and had in vain
attempted to grapple with and overthrow the pride and power of <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>England, would
be content to remain on that puny isle, within a hop, step and
jump of France, as it were, and almost within speaking distance
of the legions whom he had led to glory.&nbsp; Then we sailed
past Monte Cristo, the scene of Dumas&rsquo; celebrated romance
of that name.&nbsp; Mostly, at a distance, the isles look bare of
life and vegetation, rocks rising out of the blue waves; and yet
we know it to be otherwise.&nbsp; At best, however, they must be
poor places to live in, far from the great battle of life, and
out of touch with human progress.&nbsp; We pass Sardinia, but see
little of it.&nbsp; This is Sunday, and to-day the Church clergy,
who are numerous, seem to have had a good innings.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, I came into collision with one of them.&nbsp; As I
entered the smoking-room after breakfast, I saw there had been
held there an early Communion, and the implements utilized on
such occasions were lying about.&nbsp; In a light and flippant
tone I asked whether this was High Church or Low Church or Broad
Church.&nbsp; A little oily parson, who was apparently guarding
the vessels, angrily exclaimed, &lsquo;Sir, it is the
<i>Church</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; I said;
&lsquo;I only wanted to know.&nbsp; To me it is a matter of
indifference.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;That was very naughty of
you,&rsquo; said a mild, gentlemanly young man at my side.&nbsp;
Let everyone worship God, or what he takes to be God, as best he
may.&nbsp; I scorn not the savage who bows down to idols of wood
and stone.&nbsp; To him they represent a Divine presence and
power.&nbsp; I claim a similar liberty for the High Churchman,
who sees sacred emblems in vessels of human device to be bought
in the shops, or wrought by devout females; but let him give me
the same freedom, and not denounce me as little better than one
of the wicked, as void of Christian faith, because I turn from <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>man&rsquo;s
devices to cry out of the aching heart to the living God, if
haply I may find Him.</p>
<p>But I am digressing; for the fact is that I always see more of
sacerdotalism afloat than I do on land.&nbsp; We are getting on
pleasantly as regards social companionship.&nbsp; It was very
cold in the train to Dover, and I felt inclined to take rather a
gloomy view of the situation.&nbsp; It was worse on board the
Dover and Calais packet, where the whole of the deck was set
apart for first-class passengers, while we unfortunate
second-class men were sent down below to see what we could out of
the cabin windows.&nbsp; But once in the French second-class
carriages, really much nicer than our own, reserve was broken,
the tongue began to wag, and all went merry as a
marriage-bell.&nbsp; I was much pleased with my neighbour&mdash;a
Yorkshireman, I think, who had brought with him a bag of new
farthings to be utilized for backsheesh.&nbsp; He offered me
some, but I refused.&nbsp; At my time of life I should not like
to be caught by a wild Arab of the desert to whom I had offered a
new farthing for the familiar sovereign, the use of which is
known from China to Peru.&nbsp; The pompous elderly first-class
passenger amuses me.&nbsp; He has got his English paper, and he
carries it with him everywhere, in spite of the fact that its
news is some days old.&nbsp; One of my fellow-passengers had
bought himself at Marseilles a small footstool to keep his feet
dry&mdash;a needless precaution, as all the seats are built with
a view to protect the passengers from the damp of the decks,
always rather moist after the early morning scrub and
scour.&nbsp; The daily bath is in much request.&nbsp; The young
Englishman must have his morning bath&mdash;a favourable sign, if
it be true that <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>cleanliness is next to godliness.&nbsp; We are rather a
miscellaneous lot&mdash;there are Scotchmen, whose sweet Doric I
fail to understand, and Cockneys, who ignore the letter <i>h</i>;
but some of the ladies are charming, and that is saying a good
deal.</p>
<p>Long before we reach Naples the awnings are put up and we
rejoice in all the warmth of an English summer; and never did the
far-famed bay look more beautiful, and the towns and castles and
convents that line the cliffs in every direction for miles look
more bright.&nbsp; The usual babel of sounds reigned in the bay
as singers and divers and dealers in fruit and other articles of
Neapolitan production were clamorous to sell them.&nbsp; The
worst feature of the Neapolitan petty dealer is that he is too
anxious to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.&nbsp; I know
of many English who stay in Rome merely because the people deal
fairer with the stranger within its gates.&nbsp; It is quite
otherwise in Naples.&nbsp; The native pays fourpence for his two
pounds of bread; the Englishman always has to pay
fivepence.&nbsp; It is in vain you go to another baker.&nbsp; For
a week he will charge you fourpence, and then he raises his
price.&nbsp; One peculiarity of the Naples tradesman is that men
of the same trade always stick together; and he does not spread
out his business like the English shopkeeper of to-day.&nbsp; For
instance, if he is a baker he does not deal in pastry, and the
pastrycook does not interfere with him.&nbsp; But away from the
trading classes the poverty of the people is really awful.&nbsp;
You see men very lightly dressed sleeping on the broad pavement
at all hours; and yet they adore their King, and are now building
him a grand new monument just in front of the Royal Palace.&nbsp;
Naples still needs better drainage; and the <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>substitution
of current money in gold or silver for its copper coinage would
be a great improvement.&nbsp; Personally, this time I had no
reason to find fault with the people.&nbsp; I found an honest
boatman who rowed me to the ship for half a franc.</p>
<p>The one redeeming point in Naples is the untiring efforts of
the Protestant ministers of all denominations&mdash;Church,
Baptist, Presbyterian, and Wesleyan, the latter especially active
and doing a good work in the way of schools.&nbsp; I called in at
the Sailors&rsquo; Rest, an awful climb to get to, but a real
rest when you get there.&nbsp; The present missionary is Mr.
Burrowes, and his wife, the latter a genuine Scotchwoman of the
better sort.&nbsp; They deal in the institution and on board
ships with other peoples, with other religions and political
opinions, and the result is very satisfactory.&nbsp; The number
of destitute persons who have been relieved is as large as
ever.&nbsp; Seamen are relieved and weaned from drink.&nbsp;
Almost every evening there is something going on bright and
cheerful at the Rest.&nbsp; The Sunday evening services have been
found especially useful.&nbsp; After the evening service of a
Sunday a large number of men stop to sing their favourite hymns,
and the number of interesting temperance and religious works
circulated is very large.&nbsp; The English colporteur, Mr.
Copley, has given away 1,000 copies of the New Testament during
the year, and he is aided by a band of foreign colporteurs quite
as active as himself.&nbsp; It is work that ought to be more
liberally supported by Christians at home.&nbsp; The good it does
is great; its needs are pressing.&nbsp; I hope I may not appeal
for the Sailors&rsquo; Home of Rest at Naples in vain.&nbsp;
During the year 1895, 176 persons stayed in the Home, including
those sent there by the British <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>and foreign consuls, passing
travellers from ships.&nbsp; Many stayed only one night, such as
seamen from warships.&nbsp; About 140 persons got free teas, not
including the relief given to destitute people.&nbsp; It is a
pity that such a real good work should languish for want of
popular support amongst the wealthy English residents at Naples
and at home.</p>
<h2><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">NAPLES OF TO-DAY.</p>
<p>Once more I am in Naples, with its houses rising one over
another, in front of me, and Vesuvius looking down on me, and
across the loveliest bay the world has yet seen.&nbsp; There is
little to see in Naples beyond its museum, which no one should
omit to visit, and Pompeii, to which you are conveyed by train,
where you come face to face with ancient civilization and ancient
life.&nbsp; For the traveller the city is rich in hotels, and at
one of them&mdash;the H&ocirc;tel Vesuve, a magnificent structure
with stately halls&mdash;I once spent a happy week.&nbsp; I had
come with money enough to defray my two days&rsquo; expenses;
but, to my horror, I had to stay longer than I intended, and you
may judge of my delight when the manager, who knew me, at the end
of the week refused a penny for my board and daily food.&nbsp; I
wish I could speak as well of the shopkeepers, who fleece you as
much as possible, and are prone to give you bad money for
good.</p>
<p>The people are industrious, and mostly very poor; but they
don&rsquo;t drink, and content themselves with water and a slice
of lemon&mdash;always on sale in the streets.&nbsp; They are
devout Roman Catholics, but, <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>nevertheless, an official said to me,
&lsquo;Morality is unknown here.&rsquo;&nbsp; I met with a man
from Newcastle, an engineer, who employs a thousand people here,
and gave them an excellent character.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you employ
any English?&rsquo; I asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not one,&rsquo; was his
reply; &lsquo;they drink too much and are too
troublesome.&rsquo;&nbsp; Taxes are awful and Custom dues
ditto.&nbsp; I landed here once with twenty-five cigars, a
present from one of the gentlemanly captains of the Orient
line.&nbsp; I could have put them in my pocket, and no one would
have been any wiser.&nbsp; I thought, however, &lsquo;Italy is a
poor country, and I might as well contribute my mite towards its
exhausted exchequer.&rsquo;&nbsp; My confidence was misplaced;
for those cigars I had to pay a duty&mdash;incredible as it may
seem&mdash;of three shillings and ninepence!&nbsp; Only
fancy!</p>
<p>What I like best in Naples are its tram-cars, which are cheap,
and the attendants are civil.&nbsp; Riding and driving seem to be
the principal amusements of the people, especially on a Sunday,
when the poor horses have to rattle along with tremendous loads,
which makes one regret that in this part of the world there seems
to be no society for the prevention of cruelty to animals.&nbsp;
Pope Pius IX. did not think one required.&nbsp; Artistic
manufactures seem to constitute the staple trade.&nbsp; In every
hotel there are fine marble busts for sale.&nbsp; Vesuvius
supplies abundant lava, which is utilized in a thousand
forms.&nbsp; On many a housetop you may see the macaroni spread
out to dry, and in many a street you may watch through the
windows the tortoiseshell manufacturers at work.&nbsp; To the
city there appears to be no end, as it stretches away to the
right and left, and climbs up the hills on which it is <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>built.&nbsp;
It boasts two Gothic cathedrals, and numerous churches, and many
public buildings of a handsome order.&nbsp; Little of female
loveliness, however, is to be seen in the streets&mdash;not half
so much as in Oxford Street at home any day in the week.&nbsp;
Miss Cobbe writes: &lsquo;Naples struck me on my first
visit&mdash;as it has done again and again&mdash;as presenting
the proof that the Beautiful is not by itself the root out of
which the Good spontaneously grows.&rsquo;&nbsp; I quite agree
with Miss Cobbe.</p>
<p>In the wide and sunny expanse of blue waters that surrounds
Naples there is much to be seen.&nbsp; Rocky Capri lies just
opposite&mdash;the home of artists and English residents.&nbsp;
In the bay on our left are Bai&aelig; and Puteoli, the latter the
port at which St. Paul landed on his way as a prisoner to Rome to
appeal to C&aelig;sar.&nbsp; Bai&aelig; was the Brighton of
ancient Rome; the remains of its temples and baths are scattered
freely among the fig-trees and olives of the peasant.&nbsp;
Emperors dwelt there.&nbsp; There C&aelig;sar sought retirement,
and the warm springs on the side are yet called by his
name.&nbsp; Behind, Virgil placed the entrance of Avernus, and
not far off is his reputed tomb.&nbsp; Between Bai&aelig; and
Puteoli was the Lucrine Lake, over which coloured sails wafted
the small yachts of fashionable visitors, and which contained the
oyster-beds for the luxurious tables of Rome.&nbsp; Vitellius the
beastly, as Gibbon calls him, seems to have been the greatest
oyster-eater in the ancient world.&nbsp; He is said to have eaten
oysters all day long and to have swallowed a thousand at a
sitting.&nbsp; There are no oysters in the Lucrine Lake now, for
the simple reason that an earthquake long ago destroyed the
lake.&nbsp; All <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>that now remains of that famous fishery is a small and
shallow stream, which is separated from the sea by a narrow strip
of sand.&nbsp; Further north is Misenum, where &AElig;neas came
to land; where the navy of old Rome rode secure; from whence
Pliny sailed away to get a nearer view of the celebrated eruption
of Vesuvius, and where he met with his death by the ashes
discharged from the burning mountain.&nbsp; On the other side of
the bay lie Sorrento and other charming spots.&nbsp; It was here
the Greeks sent colonists.&nbsp; The Greeks were the colonizing
people of antiquity, as much as the English are colonizing people
of to-day.&nbsp; It is pleasant of a night to stand on the deck
of the steamer to see the gas-lamps on the shore glittering like
glow-worms or fireflies all along the romantic coast.</p>
<p>If possible, the tourist should find time to have a look at
P&aelig;stum.&nbsp; In his diary Rogers the poet thus describes
his visit: &lsquo;Country green and level.&nbsp; The temples in a
plain shut in on three sides by the mountains, on the fourth open
to the sea; and the sea itself half shut in them by the
promontory of Sorrentum, within which are the Isles of the
Sirens.&nbsp; A magnificent theatre, worthy of such objects: the
columns almost bare&mdash;broken and of an iron-brown, like iron
rust; the floor green with moss and herbage; the columns and
cornices of the richest tints, and climbed by the green lizards
that fly into a thousand chinks and crevices at your approach;
fluted fragments of columns and moulded cornices among briars
strew the middle space between the temple and the
basilica.&rsquo;&nbsp; Let me add, the temples are all in the
same Doric style.&nbsp; Poseidonia, as its inhabitants, the Greek
<a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>colonists,
called it, was founded in the seventh century <span
class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and, as the name imports, was
specially sacred to Poseidon, or Neptune.&nbsp; The principal
temple, which was probably that of Neptune, was that of the sea
god.</p>
<p>Let me remind my readers that in the English burial-place at
Naples was laid one of the very greatest and best of
Englishwomen&mdash;the late Mrs. Somerville&mdash;where a marble
monument has been placed over her grave by her daughter.&nbsp; It
represents her, heroic size, reclining on a classic chair, in
somewhat the attitude of the statue of Agrippa in the
Vatican.&nbsp; It is a shame that she was not buried in
Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; When asked, Dean Stanley assented, as
was to be expected, freely to the proposal.&nbsp; Mrs.
Somerville&rsquo;s nephew, Sir William Fraser, promised at once
to defray all expenses.&nbsp; There was only one thing further
needed, and that was the usual formal request from some public
body or official persons to the Dean and Chapter of
Westminster.&nbsp; Dean Stanley immediately wrote to the
Astronomer Royal and the President of the Royal Society, as
representative of the science with which Mrs. Somerville was
immediately connected, to ask him to authorize the Dean
proceeding in the matter.&nbsp; But that gentleman refused to do
so on the ground that he had never read Mrs. Somerville&rsquo;s
books.&nbsp; &lsquo;Whether he had read,&rsquo; writes Miss
Cobbe, commenting indignantly on the above, &lsquo;one in which
she took the opposite side from his in the bitter Adam Le Verrier
controversy, it is not for me to say.&rsquo;&nbsp; Any way,
jealousy, either scientific or masculine, declined to admit Mrs.
Somerville&rsquo;s claim to a place in our national Walhalla,
where so many men neither <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>intellectually nor morally her equal
have been received.</p>
<p>In one respect Naples has improved since I was here
last.&nbsp; The drainage has been rendered better, and the
fearful odours that met you at every turn have disappeared.&nbsp;
The poor are indolent, dirty, thriftless, and ill-housed; but
that does not much matter, as most of their lives are passed in
the open air.&nbsp; The convents are suppressed, the schoolmaster
is abroad, and they may grow better as the years roll by, and
Italy, as a nation, once more becomes great and renowned.&nbsp;
But a good deal has yet to be done.&nbsp; I heard of things to be
seen in Naples of the most disgraceful and disgusting
character.&nbsp; At the dawn of the Reformation Naples took the
lead among the Italian cities in the adoption of its
principles.&nbsp; Then came a bitter persecution, and the
triumphs of the Pope and the Inquisition.&nbsp; As the result,
Naples has been given up for years to the most abject
superstition, and its people have become the most ignorant and
demoralized in Europe.&nbsp; But the city is full of
life&mdash;far more so than is to be found in any other Italian
city.&nbsp; Such talking, shouting, and rushing to and fro can
hardly be found anywhere else.&nbsp; Nowhere is there more life
than is to be seen on the Toledo.&nbsp; One of the quaintest
objects is that of the letter-writer, seated at his desk in the
open air, with his clients waiting to have their letters
written&mdash;some of business, some of love.&nbsp; The
cab-driver is better than he looks, and it is not difficult to
get along with him.&nbsp; But you must be on your guard with
waiters.&nbsp; More than once one has come to me with a bad
franc, which he pretended I had given him; but I turned a deaf
ear to his complaint, and <a name="page19"></a><span

him to do the best he could with his spurious coin.</p>
<p>If you want to visit Vesuvius, apply at Cook&rsquo;s offices,
where you will find everything arranged for you in the most
agreeable manner, and no difficulty of any kind.&nbsp; His
funicular railway is one of the wonders of the place.&nbsp; The
ascent of the cone requires two hours&rsquo; hard walking in deep
ashes and on hard rubble lava&mdash;an undertaking not very
pleasant for people affected with delicate hearts and
constitutions, or bordering on old age.&nbsp; Get into one of
Cook&rsquo;s railway cars, and you are up in a few minutes.&nbsp;
At the lower station there is an excellent restaurant belonging
to the wonderful John Cook, whose headquarters are the Piazzi del
Martini.&nbsp; I dined once at his restaurant at the foot of the
cone, and it is one of the few dinners in my life to which I look
back with pleasure.&nbsp; I had a friend with me, of
course.&nbsp; It is never pleasant to travel&mdash;at any rate,
in a foreign country&mdash;alone.&nbsp; We had a good rumpsteak
and French beans, an omelette, and a bottle of the wine whose
praises were sung by Horace when the world was much younger and
fresher than it is now.&nbsp; After dinner we sat on the terrace,
drinking black coffee and smoking cigars.&nbsp; Of course, as an
Englishman, it gave me pleasure to reflect that our beautiful
Princess of Wales had been there before me in 1893, with Victoria
of Wales, the Duke of York, and a distinguished suite.&nbsp; As I
sat smoking, it seemed to me as if I was monarch of all I
surveyed.&nbsp; Naples was at my feet, far away behind was the
green Campagna, with but here and there a solitary dwelling, and
before me, in all its glory, the bay and its islands.&nbsp; If
old Sam Rogers had gone up there to write his <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>&lsquo;Italy,&rsquo; I think he would have done better
than he did&mdash;at any rate, I was never so near heaven before;
and this reminds me that I have said nothing of the means of
grace available to English Protestants when they come to
Naples.&nbsp; There is an English Church in the San Pasquale
&agrave; Chiagia, a Scotch Presbyterian opposite Cook&rsquo;s
offices, and a Methodist.</p>
<p>There are many ways of getting to Naples.&nbsp; I came this
time overland by Paris and Marseilles, and thence, as I have
said, by the <i>Midnight Sun</i>.&nbsp; If the weather is fine,
and the Bay of Biscay in good form, I prefer to come by the
Orient steamers right away from London.&nbsp; You have then no
trouble till you land in Naples.&nbsp; We leave Black Care behind
as we slip out of English fog and cold into the region of
cloudless skies and starry nights.&nbsp; We smoke, or read, or
feed, or walk the deck, or talk in the pleasantest manner.&nbsp;
Perhaps we get a glimpse of Finisterre.&nbsp; Heroic memories
come to us as we pass the seas where the <i>Captain</i> was
lost&mdash;it is to be feared in consequence of defective
seamanship.&nbsp; All along the coast and on those faraway hills
the noise of battle rolled, and not in vain, for the struggle
that ended in Waterloo placed England in the first rank among the
nations of the earth.</p>
<p>As soon as we cross the bay we think of Corunna and Sir John
Moore.&nbsp; Afar off are the memorable heights of Torres
Vedras.&nbsp; Cape St. Vincent, a bluff sixty feet high, with a
convent and a lighthouse, reminds one of the brilliant victory
won by Sir John Jervis, with Nelson and Collingwood fighting
under him; and in a little while we are at Trafalgar, to which
sailors still look as the greatest sea-fight in the history of
our land, and as the one that saved the nation; and <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>then you
spend a day at Gibraltar.&nbsp; A Yankee friend once said to me,
&lsquo;I must go back to America.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t stay any
longer in Europe; I shall get too conceited if I do.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I, too, feel conceited as I skirt along that romantic coast,
which you sight in a few hours after leaving Plymouth.&nbsp;
Englishmen are always grumbling.&nbsp; There is no country like
England; and an Englishman who is not proud of his native land,
and ready to make every sacrifice for her, ought to be shot, and
would be if I had my way.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">POMPEII AND VESUVIUS.</p>
<p>It is needless to write that no one can go to Naples without
paying a visit to Pompeii, if he would get a true idea of a Roman
city, with its streets, and shops, and baths, and forum, and
temples; and it is as well to read over Bulwer&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Last Days of Pompeii&rsquo;&mdash;that master work of
genius, compared with which our present popular novels are poor
indeed&mdash;and then let the reader spend an entire day, if he
can, among the Pompeiian remains, in the museum at Naples, which
Garibaldi, when Dictator of Naples, handed over to the
people.&nbsp; Pompeii is easy of access by the railway, which
lands you at the very spot, after a short but pleasant
trip.&nbsp; Much can be accomplished there and back for a little
more than three francs.&nbsp; On Sundays Pompeii can be visited
for nothing; on other days the charge is one franc, and when you
have paid the guide the franc, I think you will agree with me
that in no other part of the world can you see so much that is
truly wonderful at so small an expense.&nbsp; Close to the gate
are a hotel&mdash;the H&ocirc;tel du Diomede&mdash;and a
restaurant, at either of which you can get all the refreshments
you require; and if it is too hot to walk&mdash;and in the summer
months Pompeii is a very hot <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>place indeed&mdash;there are chairs
in the grounds in which you can be carried all round and see all
that is to be seen at very little personal fatigue.</p>
<p>Pompeii is spread out in an elliptical form on the brow of a
hill, and extends over a space of nearly two miles.&nbsp; On one
side of you is Vesuvius, and on the other the blue waters of the
bay.&nbsp; One of the towns through which you pass in the train
is Portici, the ancient Herculaneum; as it is, you are lost in
wonder at the awful extent of the catastrophe which turned all
this smiling land into a scene of desolation and death, and
which, at any rate, led to the extinction of one philosophic
career&mdash;that of the elder Pliny, a real victim to the
pursuit of knowledge under difficulties.&nbsp; At the time of its
visitation, Pompeii is reputed to have had a population of about
26,000.</p>
<p>Imagination fails to realize the agony of the hour as the
swift, black, sulphurous death came down on all&mdash;the
patrician in his marble halls, the tradesman in his shop, the
miser at his desk, the devotees who cried to their gods for
safety in vain, the slave, the freedman, the aged, to whom life
had nothing to give, the tender, the beautiful, the young, to
whom life seemed an exhaustless dream of joy.&nbsp; As in the
days of the flood, there was marrying and giving in
marriage.&nbsp; Here the baker had fled, and left his loaves in
his oven; there was an eating-house, in which were found raisins,
olives, and fish cooked in oil.&nbsp; There stands the tavern,
indicated by the sign of the chequers, while the amphor&aelig; of
wines are still marked with the year of the vintage.&nbsp; An
election was going on at the time of the catastrophe, and appeals
to the free and independent are still preserved.&nbsp; In one
place a schoolboy has <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>scratched his Greek alphabet.&nbsp;
In his sentry-box a sentinel was discovered, a grisly skeleton
clasping his rusty sword.&nbsp; And the streets tell a piteous
tale.&nbsp; In one a young man and woman had fallen together; in
another part a lady was discovered attempting to flee with a bag
of gold, and then there was seen the skeleton of a mother with
her children, whom she was vainly seeking to save.&nbsp; In the
house of Diomede, or, rather, in a vaulted cellar underneath,
eighteen bodies were found of men and women who had evidently
fled there for shelter.&nbsp; The probable proprietor of the
house was found near the garden door, with the key in his hand,
while beside him was a slave with valuables.&nbsp; It is evident
that the city was a scene of vice and dissipation.&nbsp; Some of
the inscriptions are too indecent to reproduce.&nbsp; I know not
whether for this it becomes us to point the finger of scorn, we
who read &lsquo;Don Juan,&rsquo; who revel in Fielding, who
reverence Dean Swift, who know what goes on in Paris and London
by night, when respectability has gone to bed and Exeter Hall is
shut up.</p>
<p>Let me turn to the streets&mdash;they are very
narrow&mdash;and to the houses, which strike me as generally very
small.&nbsp; In that grand climate the people must have mostly
lived in the open air.&nbsp; One of the most elegant houses is
that of the Tragic Poet.&nbsp; On the threshold was a dog in
mosaic, with the inscription &lsquo;Cave canem&rsquo;&mdash;now
in the museum at Naples.&nbsp; I was much interested in the
public baths, or therm&aelig;, which indicate with how much care
the ancient Romans attended to cleanliness and health.&nbsp; They
must have been on a somewhat extensive scale.&nbsp; A passage
leads to the chamber for undressing.&nbsp; Beyond this is the
cold bath.&nbsp; <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>Thence we make our way to the warm bath, or
tepidarium.&nbsp; The baths also possessed an extensive
colonnade, now converted into a garden, besides several other
chambers and baths for women, none of which are now open to the
public.&nbsp; But we see wonders everywhere, in spite of the fact
that all that is best in Pompeii has been moved to the museum at
Naples, where remains one of the finest of the Pompeiian
mosaics&mdash;that representing a battle between Darius and
Alexander, which no one who wishes to have a competent idea of
ancient art should avoid going to see.&nbsp; Let me add that no
visitor should go to Pompeii without having first got a clear
idea of what he is going to see.&nbsp; The guides are but poor
helps, as mostly they speak nothing but Italian.&nbsp; Further,
let me say that if you have at Naples only the day allowed by the
Orient Company, while waiting for the overland mails, which
generally reach Naples in a little over two days and nights after
leaving London, your best plan is to get hold of Cook&rsquo;s
agent, who reaches the ship in a boat with a flag bearing the
well-known name.&nbsp; He will take you off, drive you straight
to Pompeii, give you time to &lsquo;do&rsquo; the place and to
get a good lunch there, and bring you back in time to the ship to
pursue the even tenor of your way to Egypt, or Ceylon, or
Australia, as the case may be.&nbsp; If you have time, pursue
your studies by a day in the museum, or more if you can.&nbsp; It
is there you can realize best, as you study the grand statues of
great men and women and gods and goddesses, the Diana of Ephesus
being one of them&mdash;statues in which the</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Majesty of human
passion<br />
Is to the life expressed&rsquo;&mdash;</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>what
men the world&rsquo;s masters were.&nbsp; Nero has a shocking
head; Caligula looks an empty-headed fop; but I gazed admiringly
on the grand features of my guide, philosopher, and
friend&mdash;Marcus Aurelius.&nbsp; And I thought of Voltaire, as
I stood opposite the noble statue of Julius C&aelig;sar, on your
left just as you enter the museum.&nbsp; Voltaire tells us men
may be divided into two classes&mdash;hammers and anvils.&nbsp;
Julius C&aelig;sar evidently belonged to the former class.&nbsp;
It was there, too, I saw a Venus, radiant in innocence and beauty
and sweetness and grace, as if new &lsquo;bathed in Paphian
foam&rsquo;&mdash;the only Venus I ever could have loved.&nbsp;
But I had no guide-book, and the day was hot, and all the
attendants were fast asleep.</p>
<p>Let me add a caution: Never change money if you can help
it.&nbsp; You are sure to get a bad franc if you do.&nbsp; At
Pompeii the guide tried it on with me.&nbsp; Again, while waiting
for the train at Pompeii, I was tempted to have a deal with a
pedlar, who asked me ten francs for souvenirs, which I
subsequently bought, after a good deal of haggling, for
five.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I had only a ten-franc note, and he
had to give me change&mdash;not in coppers, as they generally do
in Naples, where silver is scarce, but in francs; and one of them
was bad, as I found out when I went to the museum next day.&nbsp;
To my disgust, the civil gentleman who takes the money kindly cut
it in two.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will call for you at a quarter-past seven,&rsquo;
said Cook&rsquo;s agent to me, as he left the <i>Ormuz</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come at that hour,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;I will be
ready.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alas! man proposes&mdash;often in vain.&nbsp; I went to bed
early.&nbsp; I had made arrangements for an early meal.&nbsp; I
had agreed to see that a fellow-passenger who was <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>to come
should be ready; but I could not sleep&mdash;the heat in the bay
was too great, the odour of the tide-less waters seemed to
possess my soul, and as I lay awake all the chronic diseases by
which I am borne down reasserted themselves, and I didn&rsquo;t
get a wink of sleep till just as it was time to get up.&nbsp; I
have an early breakfast, and yet there is no sign of Cook&rsquo;s
agent.&nbsp; In due time I see him, and my friend and I and
Cook&rsquo;s agent are rowed on shore, and we drive to
Cook&rsquo;s headquarters.&nbsp; There we are put into a carriage
drawn by three horses, and away we go along the crowded
streets.&nbsp; What a display we have on every side of the
unwashed, as they sit at the shop doors, or at the corners of the
long narrow alleys in which most of them live!&nbsp; There are
naked children, hideous old women, and very unlovely young
ones.&nbsp; A fat priest passes with his beaver hat and black
robes, and a young woman rushes at him and kisses his hand.&nbsp;
The priest and the militaire are to be seen everywhere.&nbsp; No
wonder the country is poor.</p>
<p>As we proceed the ground begins to rise, and we see pleasant
villas with decent gardens.&nbsp; As we rise so does the dust;
for mostly we are shut in between two walls, over which we see
the vine hang heavily, or apricots glitter among the green
branches on either side.&nbsp; Here and there is a break in the
wall, and, seated at rustic tables, peasants and their families
are enjoying a holiday, looking under their vine arbours across
the blue bay or pleasant Capri, or glancing upward at the smoking
mountain above.&nbsp; At one of these wayside publics our driver
stops to water horses, which are useful animals, and, in spite of
the heat, never turn a hair.&nbsp; We enter the principal room,
at <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>one end
of which is a big bed, while nearer the door is a table with wine
and glasses, and fruit, and specimens of lava and other
matters.&nbsp; My friend, with the recklessness of youth, spends
his money.&nbsp; I refuse to do anything of the kind; and again
our coachman urges on his wild career.&nbsp; He pulls up again as
a woman rushes out of her cabin to offer us drink.&nbsp; Again we
are tempted, and in vain.&nbsp; Then we reach a level of reeds
and rushes, where resides a venerable and unwashed hermit, who
sighs as he turns in and thinks of the hardness of our
hearts.&nbsp; We are now nearly out of the cultivated land, as we
see the gigantic fields of lava on every side; where it can all
have come from is a mystery.&nbsp; You can scarcely realize how
all this lava&mdash;stretched on every hand, far and
wide&mdash;can ever have come out of that crater.&nbsp; There
seems more lava than you could get into the mountain itself; and
how terrible must have been the scene when the red-hot lava
rushed down the mountain-side, overwhelming green vines, and
square-roofed huts, and living animals, and smiling babes, and
weak and helpless old age!&nbsp; As it cooled, it seems to have
wreathed itself into a thousand fantastic shapes&mdash;and yet
the scene is fair and tranquil.&nbsp; A small wreath of smoke at
the top only suggests a feeble fire within, and down far below
the blue Mediterranean sleeps, and gay Naples sparkles, and the
great Campagna opens up its vast green solitudes, save where,
here and there, a white-stoned villa varies its monotony.&nbsp;
Around me animal life exists not.&nbsp; The yellow birch blooms
in her golden beauty, that is all, and the common white butterfly
of England has the upper airs all to herself.</p>
<p>As we reach the observatory&mdash;an oasis in the
desert&mdash;<a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>we meet a couple of sportsmen; they have a gun between
them, though why I cannot understand, as I see nothing to shoot
at but lizards, and so we are drawn slowly on the dusty road,
which zigzags in the most wonderful manner every few yards.&nbsp;
We enter through a gateway which, I presume, marks the bounds of
the Cook territory, as one of his agents takes a look at our
tickets.&nbsp; With joy our brown-faced coachman points us to a
white, flat-roofed building, which he declares truly is the
hotel, where he intimates we can have lunch, and where he
intimates he can do the same if we will supply the
cash&mdash;which we do, though he had no right to ask
it&mdash;and weaned and parched we enter the grateful portals of
the hotel to feast, and to enjoy a refreshing breeze, which we
should have sought for in Naples in vain.&nbsp; As I rested
there, I felt no wish to depart either upwards or downwards.</p>
<p>Of course the summer is the bad time for the crater.&nbsp; In
the season Cook has his pilgrims, sometimes to the number of 200
a day.&nbsp; The cars are airy and light.&nbsp; As one goes up,
another descends, and thus the work goes on under the care of an
able German, who caught a fever in Egypt, and has been ordered
here for the benefit of his health.&nbsp; The whole country
should be called Cooksland.&nbsp; It is there John Cook reigns
supreme.&nbsp; Just as I was leaving London a Leicester gentleman
said to me: &lsquo;I wonder Mr. Gladstone did not make John Cook
a baronet.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The man who does what Mr. Cook
does, for all travellers, whatever their nationality, surely
deserves public recognition,&rsquo; says a commercial Dutchman to
me as I write; &lsquo;I am off to Palermo and Catana and
Messina.&nbsp; I have taken Cook&rsquo;s tickets for all the
way.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>I found
in my subsequent travels every one of us had more or less to
enjoy the assistance of Cook&rsquo;s agents.&nbsp; In many cases
travellers derive great pecuniary benefit from doing so.&nbsp; I
remember a friend of mine got some money changed for him by
Cook&rsquo;s agent on very much cheaper terms than he could
anywhere else.</p>
<p>Italy is a poor country; yet it displays a sense of humour
highly creditable under the circumstances.&nbsp; The site of the
Custom House in Naples is locally known as the Immaculate.</p>
<h2><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">THE ISLES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN.</p>
<p>Remember, as the great Dr. Johnson remarks, how life consists
not of a series of illustrious actions or elegant enjoyments; the
greater part of our time passes in compliance with necessities in
the performance of daily duties, in the procurement of petty
pleasures; and we are well or ill at ease as the main stream of
life glides on smoothly, or is ruffled by small obstacles and
frequent interruptions.&nbsp; This is emphatically true as
regards life at sea.&nbsp; But as we steam along we see much to
attract and excite in the isles of the Mediterranean, that
diversify the travel all the way from Marseilles to Jaffa.&nbsp;
It is said that there are eighty ports in the Mediterranean, and
that into all of them Lord Brassey can take his yacht without a
pilot.&nbsp; Alas! I am permitted to tarry at none of them.</p>
<p>As we sail out of the Bay of Naples we pass Capri&mdash;a
rocky island, where there is scarce a yard of level
ground&mdash;dear to Englishmen and artists.&nbsp; The highest
point of Capri is about 1,960 feet above the sea.&nbsp; The
traveller will find there several hotels.&nbsp; Roman remains
abound, and Tiberius, the drunken and dissolute, had twelve
palaces there.&nbsp; There he was in no fear of unwelcome <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>intrusion,
and gave himself up to shameless and unnatural lusts; while his
worthy lieutenant, Sejanus, carried on a series of persecutions
against all who stood in any relation to the imperial family, or
excited the suspicions of the tyrant by freedom of speech,
independence of character, or position, or popularity.&nbsp; The
famous Blue Grotto of Capri is on the northern side, near the
landing.&nbsp; In the great war with France, Sir Hudson
Lowe&mdash;the same General who had subsequently charge of
Bonaparte at St. Helena&mdash;had to surrender the island to
Murat, after a fortnight&rsquo;s siege, and had the mortification
of seeing reinforcements arrive just after the treaty was
signed.&nbsp; Leaving Capri, the Gulf of Salerno opens;
P&aelig;stum, with its temples, lying on the southern bight of
the gulf.&nbsp; Then follows the elevated headland of Cape
Palinure&mdash;named after Palinurus, the pilot of &AElig;neas,
whose tomb is marked by a tower on the cliff some eight miles
northward, thus fulfilling the Sibyl&rsquo;s promise in the
&lsquo;&AElig;neid,&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;And Palinurus&rsquo; name the place shall
bear.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We next get a peep at the now active volcano of Stromboli, and
the Lipari Islands to the northward.&nbsp; On these islands, the
Insul&aelig;-Eoli&aelig;, also the Vulcani&aelig; of the
ancients, &AElig;olus held the winds enclosed in caverns, letting
them blow and howl as it seemed good in his sight.&nbsp; There,
too, Vulcan forged the bolts of Jove.</p>
<p>From Naples we steer for Sicily, once, though only for a short
time, prosperous under British rule, when we took possession of
it in the name of the King of Naples, after he was driven away
from Italy by the <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>soldiers of France.&nbsp; Garibaldi handed it over to
United Italy.&nbsp; Sicily is a country which is almost unknown
to tourists, though in his youth Mr. Gladstone visited the island
and wrote: &lsquo;After Etna, the temples are the great charm and
attraction of Sicily.&nbsp; I do not know whether there is any
one, if taken alone, which exceeds in interest and beauty that of
Neptune at P&aelig;stum, but they have the advantage of number
and variety as well as of interesting position.&rsquo;&nbsp; We
pass Catania, which had the most celebrated University in
Italy.&nbsp; The present town is comparatively new; many of its
more ancient remains are covered with lava; among them the
theatre, from which it is probable Alcibiades addressed the
people in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 415.&nbsp; What
memories rose up before us as we steamed along the Straits of
Messina!&nbsp; It was from Syracuse that St. Paul sailed away to
Reggio, on the coast of Italy, and all the parsons on board pull
out their Testaments and compare notes.&nbsp; I trow I know more
of the Greeks, and Romans, and Carthaginians, who shed so much
blood, and waged so many desolating wars in these now peaceful
regions.&nbsp; The town was founded by the Greeks nearly 3,000
years ago.&nbsp; All the nations seem at one time to have held
Sicily&mdash;Romans, Greeks, Moors, Turks, and Normans.&nbsp;
There are some of us who can yet remember how Cicero thundered
against Verres for his misgovernment of Sicily.&nbsp; It was to
Sicily that &AElig;schylus retired to die after Sophocles had
borne away the prize from him for his tragedy.&nbsp; The pet of
the Athenian mob, the gay and graceful Alcibiades, fought against
the Sicilians in vain.&nbsp; At that time they must have been a
more intelligent people than they are now.&nbsp; Take, for
instance, their appreciation of <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Euripides.&nbsp; Of all the poets,
writes old Plutarch, he was the man with whom the Sicilians were
most in love.&nbsp; From every stranger that landed in their
island they gained every small specimen or portion of his works,
and communicated it with pleasure to each other.&nbsp; It is said
that on one occasion a number of Athenians, upon their return
home defeated, went to Euripides and thanked him for teaching
their masters what they remembered of his poems; and others were
rewarded when they were wandering about after the battle, for
singing a few of his verses.&nbsp; Nor is this to be wondered at,
since they tell us that when a ship from Cannes, which happened
to be pursued by pirates, was going to take shelter in one of
their ports, the Sicilians at first refused to receive her.&nbsp;
Upon asking the crew whether they knew any of the verses of
Euripides, and being answered in the affirmative, they released
both them and their vessel.&nbsp; We are a cultured people.&nbsp;
The Americans, according to their own ideas, are yet more
so.&nbsp; Yet it is evident that the Sicilians were far before us
in their admiration of poetic genius.&nbsp; Alas! Pompey the
Great, as we still call him, gave the Sicilians a different
lesson when he summoned the people of Messina before him, who
refused to obey his summons, arguing that they stood excused by
an ancient privilege granted them by the Romans.&nbsp; His reply
was, and it was worthy of the present Emperor of Germany,
&lsquo;Will you never have done citing laws and privileges to men
who wear swords?&rsquo;&nbsp; Another lesson Sicily teaches us is
how much readier the world is to remember its oppressors than its
benefactors.&nbsp; We all have a vivid impression of Dionysius,
the Tyrant of Syracuse, yet how few of us <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>are familiar
with the fame of Dion the Patriot, who was the pupil of Plato
when the philosopher dwelt for a time in Syracuse.&nbsp; It is to
the credit of the Sicilians that they were a grateful
people.&nbsp; When Timoleon died they gave him a public funeral,
and instituted games in his honour, &lsquo;as the man who
destroyed tyrants, subdued barbarians, repeopled great cities
which lay desolate, and restored the Sicilians their laws and
privileges.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Gradually we make our way through the Straits, sailing between
Scylla and Charybdis, which for the modern traveller has no
terrors.&nbsp; Our last view of Sicily gives us a fine glimpse of
Etna, with the crater into which Empedocles threw himself, 400
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&nbsp; Men are immortalized as
much by their follies as by their virtues.&nbsp; As we onward
press we get a glimpse of Candia, with the snowy peaks of Mount
Ida, and Gavodo, or Goro, supposed to be the Clauda of St.
Paul&rsquo;s voyage to the westward.&nbsp; What associations rise
as we see Cephalonia, Zante, Corfu!&mdash;all looking dry and
bare in the scorching sun.&nbsp; We manage to make our way,
though with some difficulty, through the Canal of Corinth, a work
which I fear can never pay, as it is not large enough for the big
steamers which now plough these waters.&nbsp; Everywhere islands,
or rather rocks, diversify the scene, and every day we have more
radiant sunsets and sunrises than you can realize in a Northern
clime.&nbsp; To sail on this summer sea is indeed a treat.&nbsp;
No wonder old Ulysses loved to wander among these isles, and to
leave Penelope to do her knitting and to look after her maids at
home.&nbsp; I regret that I cannot have a peep at Crete and
Cyprus, the most famous islands <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>in the Mediterranean, and we pass
over the far-famed bay of Salamis almost unconsciously.</p>

</a></p>
<p>It is not my privilege to sail from one of the historic isles
of the Mediterranean to another, nor do I know that in all cases
it would be safe.&nbsp; In many cases besides Corsica and Sicily
the traveller has to look to his ways.&nbsp; There are brigands
to be met with still and as we travelled we heard of a British
officer who had just been made captive as he wandered about in
search of a day&rsquo;s shooting.&nbsp; As you may well suppose,
I gave the brigands a wide berth.&nbsp; I am quite content with
being fleeced by guides and hotel-keepers.&nbsp; When I was in
Australia, I was amused to learn that <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>the last of the bushrangers had
sailed to America to carry on a hotel.&nbsp; I fear that in many
parts of the world the two callings have much in common.&nbsp; I
believe the British pay no taxes&mdash;at any rate, they do not
in Jerusalem&mdash;and this is one reason why we meet with such
swarms of shady Greeks who claim to be British subjects.&nbsp; In
this part of the world the <i>Civis Romanus sum</i> of old
Palmerston seems to me in danger of being carried a deal too
far.&nbsp; Not that I am a Little Englander; I am, in fact, very
much the reverse.</p>
<p>Over these waters sailed the hardy mariners of ancient Greece
in search of the Golden Fleece, and the brave Theseus, as he went
to do battle with the monster Minos, who demanded a yearly
tribute of Athenian maids.&nbsp; We all went on deck to have a
look at Patmos, where the Apostle John wrote that wondrous dream,
the Revelation, and viewed with interest the white convent on the
island which still bears his name.</p>
<p>In the Sea of Marmora we pass the Princes Islands, four of
which are inhabited.&nbsp; In one of them is the grave of Sir
Edward Barton, the first resident British Ambassador in
Turkey.&nbsp; He was sent by Queen Elizabeth to the Sultan
Mahommed III., and died in 1507.&nbsp; Another of them, Plati,
was purchased by Sir H. Bulwer while Ambassador to
Constantinople.&nbsp; He built a castle on it, which is now
falling into ruins, and later sold the island to the ex-Khedive
of Egypt, to whose family it still belongs.&nbsp; Steaming south,
we pass Alexandria Troas, which was twice visited by St.
Paul.&nbsp; On the first occasion he came down from Mysia and
went to Macedonia; on the second, on his return from Greece, he
had an interview with a large <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>body of fellow-workers.&nbsp; It was
there he restored Eutychus, who had fallen from an upper window
in his sleep.</p>
<p>Next we pass the ancient island of Lesbos, one of the most
beautiful in the &AElig;gean Sea.&nbsp; Islands are around us
everywhere.&nbsp; There is no end to them.&nbsp; The most thickly
populated of them is Chio; another is Cos, of which we see the
chief town, the birthplace of Hippocrates, the great
physician.&nbsp; Then we pass Rhodes, famous for its renowned
knights, who did battle with the ever-advancing Turk, of whom
Luther had such fear, and its grand Colossus overthrown and
broken in pieces by an earthquake fifty-six years after its
erection, <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 224; and then we leave
the lovely Mediterranean at Jaffa, where, according to Greek
mythology, Andromeda was chained to the rock and delivered by
Perseus, and where the prophet Jonah embarked when he tried to
escape the command of God to go and warn Nineveh of its impending
fate.&nbsp; Of course I went to the house where St. Peter lived,
the dwelling of Simon the tanner, a very dreary, tumbledown old
place, which required a good deal of climbing, rather trying in
that sultry clime.&nbsp; And here I leave that wonderful
Mediterranean over which the navies of all the world in all ages
have swept.</p>

41</span>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">ABOUT ATHENS.</p>
<p>For the first time in my life, I realize the fact that the
Mediterranean is a lake&mdash;calm and blue as the eyes we
love.&nbsp; What astonishes me is the absence of life in these
waters.&nbsp; All is barren as that dreary sail across the Indian
Ocean from Ceylon to West Australia.&nbsp; Really, if it were not
for the photographers, who are always at work on board, we should
be rather dull.&nbsp; It is really wonderful the number of
amateur photographers who have come out in the <i>Midnight
Sun</i>, and are daily having recourse to their art; and
sometimes the consequences are ludicrous.&nbsp; For instance, we
have a considerable number of respectable married people on
board.&nbsp; Amongst them are a young couple whose experience of
matrimonial felicity has been, I suspect, somewhat of the
shortest.&nbsp; One morning they were &lsquo;far from the madding
crowd,&rsquo; indulging in little familiarities, such as leaning
on one another&rsquo;s shoulders&mdash;quite proper, as we must
all admit, but rather suited for private than public life.&nbsp;
Well, a photographer had his eye on them, and straightway made
them his victims.&nbsp; There they were, large and fully
recognisable.&nbsp; His praiseworthy <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>attempt was greeted with a roar of
laughter, of which the victims, far away (the artist was on the
upper deck), had not the remotest idea.&nbsp; Let me add the
moral: let me beg the newly-married ones to beware of the
photographers.&nbsp; More numerous than the photographers are the
ladies and gentlemen who spend their mornings in writing their
diaries&mdash;if with a view to publication, a sad look-out.</p>
<p>In due time we reach Attica, and are landed at the
Pir&aelig;us, which is busy now as when Themistocles planned the
harbour and Pericles planted its walls, five miles in
length.&nbsp; The town has quite a modern look; nothing of its
ancient glory remains.&nbsp; Its modern history dates from
1834.&nbsp; A modern lighthouse marks the site of the tomb of
Themistocles.&nbsp; A railway, made in 1869, now connects the
Pir&aelig;us with Athens, and it grows apace.&nbsp; In old times
there was rarely to be seen any boat in the harbour.&nbsp; In
1871 the population was only 11,000; in 1890 it had grown to
36,000, About 6,000 vessels of over two and a half millions of
tonnage, one half of which is in Greek bottoms, enter the harbour
annually.&nbsp; As a town, it consists chiefly of commercial
buildings and unpretending private residences.&nbsp; It has,
however, an arsenal, a military and naval school, several
handsome churches for the orthodox members of the Greek Church,
an interesting museum of antiquities, and a gymnasium.&nbsp;
Trains run to Athens through the whole day until midnight.&nbsp;
We land in a homely quarter of the town.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is in
the spring,&rsquo; writes Edmond About, &lsquo;one sees Attica in
her glory, when the air is so clear and transparent that it seems
as if one had only to put forth one&rsquo;s hand to touch the
furthest mountains; when <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>it carries sounds so faithfully that
one can hear the bleating of flocks half a mile away, and the
cries of great eagles, which are lost to sight in the immensity
of the skies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I find Athens hot and dusty&mdash;a fine white dust, which
makes everything look desolate.&nbsp; I get hold of a plan of
Athens, showing me how to make the most of six days, but as I
have not that time to spare, one&rsquo;s first thoughts turn
naturally to the Acropolis, a rocky plateau of crystallized
limestone, rising to about 200 feet.&nbsp; Romans, Goths,
Byzantines, and Turks have done their best to make Athens a heap
of ruins.&nbsp; It was well that Lord Elgin did so much to
preserve some of the choicest relics of Athens by bringing them
to England and sending them to the British Museum.&nbsp; Had he
not done so, they would have been inevitably destroyed by the
unspeakable Turk, a fact deeply to be deplored.</p>
<p>One night we had an amusing illustration of the qualification
of the fair sex for the right to rule over man.&nbsp; There was a
concert in the smoking-room, the finest apartment in the
ship.&nbsp; Amongst the performers were some ladies, and a good
many were auditors.&nbsp; Suddenly a large rat made its
appearance, when all the ladies, shrieking, fled.&nbsp; I may not
be equal to the New Woman&mdash;of course she is far above
me&mdash;but, at any rate, I am not afraid to face a rat.&nbsp;
Fancy a rat appearing in the House of Commons with a lady speaker
on her legs, and a Government of ladies seated gracefully and in
the loveliest of toilettes!&nbsp; The result would be appalling
and disastrous.</p>
<p>The country through which we passed was quite dried up, and
quite prepared me for the tasteless beef <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>and skinny
fowl of which I was to partake afterwards at the H&ocirc;tel
Grand Bretagne, where they charged me two francs for a cigar; and
where, when I remonstrated, I was told that the taxes were so
high that they could not afford to let me have one for
less.&nbsp; There are a great many trees about, but they have all
a dwarfed and dried-up appearance.&nbsp; Far off rises the great
Acropolis; you may see it from the steps of the hotel, and the
ruins on its top.&nbsp; The life of the streets amuses me.&nbsp;
It is incessant and ever varying.&nbsp; The soldier is
conspicuous, as he is everywhere on the Continent; priests in
black robes and peculiar black hats are plentiful, grave and
black-bearded, though I am told that in reality they have little
hold on the people of Athens.&nbsp; I have been in one of the
churches, very dark, and with a lot of ornamentation; and quite a
number of people&mdash;very old ones&mdash;came and crossed
themselves, after the Greek fashion, before a picture just inside
the door.&nbsp; Ladies are to be seen, few of them with any
particular personal charm, but all in the latest fashions of
Paris; and there come the girls with pigtails.&nbsp; I see one of
the French illustrated newspapers everywhere.&nbsp; Among the
daily papers published in Athens are the <i>Ora</i> (Hour), the
<i>Plinghensia</i> (Regeneration), <i>Neai Ideai</i> (New Idea),
<i>Aion</i> (Era), <i>Toia</i> (Morning), and <i>Telegrafui</i>
(The Telegram).&nbsp; The most curious people you see are the men
from the country, with black waistcoats, white petticoats&mdash;I
can give them no other name&mdash;dark hose, and antique-looking
shoes turned up at the toes and decorated&mdash;why, I know
not&mdash;with enormous tufts.&nbsp; The living objects I most
pity are the forlorn, half-starved donkeys, loaded fore and aft
<a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>with
luggage, while in the centre, on his saddle, is seated his
hard-hearted proprietor.&nbsp; Some of the shops are fine, but
few of the houses are lofty&mdash;the most striking being modern
buildings, built on the plan to admit as much air as possible,
and to exclude the light.&nbsp; But you see no beggars in the
streets, and that is a good sign.&nbsp; Greece has, as you know,
the most democratic Government of any.&nbsp; The King, who is not
very popular, reigns, but does not govern.&nbsp; The real power
is in the hands of the Legislative Chamber&mdash;there is no
Upper House&mdash;consisting of 150 members, all paid for their
services, and elected by means of universal suffrage and the
ballot every four years.&nbsp; The population of Athens is about
160,000, with the addition of 3,000 Armenian refugees who have
found there a city of refuge.&nbsp; Education is free and
compulsory, reaching from the lowest strata to the University, so
that every lad of talent has a chance.&nbsp; If democracy can
make a people happy and content and prosperous, the Greeks ought
to be content.&nbsp; There must be a good many wealthy men at
Athens, however, whom the democracy have wisely spared.&nbsp; It
is not right to kill the goose that lays the golden egg, as is
desired by some of our Socialists.</p>
<p>Modern Greece, with the exception of America, is the most
republican Government in existence; at any rate, it is ahead of
England in this respect.&nbsp; We want, or, rather, some people
do, who do not know any better, to agitate for payment of
members.&nbsp; I object because I have seen the mischief of paid
members in all our colonies, and because when I part with my
scanty cash I like to have value for my money; and as I know the
average M.P., I think he is dear at any price.&nbsp; The men <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>in office are
bitterly opposed by the men who languish in the cold shade of
Opposition, and that really seems the only line of
cleavage.&nbsp; For instance, if a Minister proposes that a
certain work should be done by a certain number of horses, the
Opposition argue that oxen should be used, and so the battle
rages, for the modern Greek, degenerate though he is, is still as
fond of talk and windy declamation as any long-winded and
ambitious M.P. at home.&nbsp; Ministers, though appointed by the
King, are amenable to the Chamber, but under this system we do
not hear of the great Parliament, such as we have at home or in
Italy or France.</p>
<p>For administrative purposes Greece is divided into sixteen
monarchies, governed by municipalities, who alone have the power
to levy rates and taxes.&nbsp; These monarchies are divided into
eparchies and domarchies, the later under the control of the
mayor, elected by the people.&nbsp; Thus in Greece alone, in the
Old World, we have government of the people and for the
people.&nbsp; For purposes of justice there are local courts;
five Courts of Appeal, and a Supreme Court at Athens.&nbsp; In
matters of education, again, Greece is far ahead of us.&nbsp; We
want to connect the people with the Universities, so that the
poorest lad may have his chance.&nbsp; In Greece this result is
obtained.&nbsp; Ample provision is made for the elementary
schools, leading from the lowest strata of society up to the
Universities, free and compulsory&mdash;not that the latter
provision needs to be enforced, as naturally there is a great
desire for education all over the land.&nbsp; The Greek Church is
the established one, but any undue zeal on the part of the priest
is held in check both by law and the spirit of <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>religious
toleration.&nbsp; Among her subjects Greece reckons as many as
25,000 Moslems.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Passing out of the Pir&aelig;us, to our right we notice a
monument to the memory of one of the wild heroes of Grecian
Independence, whose insolent followers were a great trouble to
our Lord Byron during his fatal sojourn at Missolonghi.&nbsp; In
due time we arrive within sight of the Temple of Theseus and the
other well <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>known landmarks familiar to the cultivated reader.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, the approach to Athens is not very interesting, as
we enter through one of its most homely quarters.&nbsp; The
principal modern institutions are the Polytechnic School, divided
into three branches&mdash;the School of Fine Art, the Industrial
School, and the Holiday School, where on Sundays and feast-days
instruction is given in writing, elementary drawing, etc.; there
is also a School of Telegraphy.&nbsp; In the same neighbourhood
is also to be found the Academy of Science; next to the Academy
is the University, adorned with statues of the famous men who
helped to make modern Greece.&nbsp; The classes at the University
are practically free, and the number of students attending is
generally between 3,000 and 4,000.&nbsp; The library in
connection with the University has 100,000 volumes.</p>
<p>It is impossible to do justice to the activity of the life in
these parts; there are many steamers in the harbour&mdash;I saw
two steam away one morning.&nbsp; Naples seems a very sleepy
place compared to the Pir&aelig;us.&nbsp; Little white boats,
with leg-of-mutton sails, skim the blue waters of the harbour all
day long, and the men are lean and dark, and wonderfully active,
a great contrast to our English sailors.&nbsp; Once upon a time,
coming from New York, we called off Portland Bill for a
pilot.&nbsp; It was midnight, and dark as Erebus, but we all sat
up waiting for the pilot, to hear the English news.&nbsp;
Suddenly there climbed up the ship&rsquo;s side, and stood on the
deck in the full glare of light, two awful living mountains of
flesh, as fat as beer and bacon could make them&mdash;a couple of
English pilots.&nbsp; We had some skinny American ladies on
board, and when they saw these men they uttered quite an
appalling shriek.&nbsp; <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>They had never seen such specimens of
humanity before.&nbsp; I own I felt really ashamed of my
fellow-countrymen, and asked myself why on earth men should make
themselves such guys.&nbsp; Happily, in Australia I lost a couple
of stone, and I have been mercifully preserved from laying on
flesh ever since.&nbsp; Flesh is the great source of human
depravity.&nbsp; With Falstaff, I hold the more of it the more
frailty.</p>

<p>And now let me return to Athens, the Acropolis of which I see
in all its glory, and on which by night lights gleam that you can
see in the harbour, crowning the belt of bright lamps which by
night glorify the whole front of the town.&nbsp; They show you
Mars&rsquo; Hill, <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>where Paul preached the unknown God; the porch of the
Erechtheum, sacred to the olive-tree, brought to Greece by
Athene; and the Parthenon, which still attests the genius of
Phidias.&nbsp; Of Athens it may be said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Her shores are those whence many a mighty
bard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Caught inspiration glorious in their beams;<br />
Her hills the same that heroes died to guard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her vales that fostered Art&rsquo;s divinest
dreams.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Modern Athens is bright and cheerful, the shops gay and lofty,
with well-known Greek names.&nbsp; The latter remark also applies
to the streets.&nbsp; The hotels are magnificent.&nbsp; The
H&ocirc;tel d&rsquo;Angleterre is well spoken of, and the
dragoman Apostoles will be found an intelligent servant, who will
arrange for the traveller who is disposed to make an excursion in
the Morea for food, lodging, mules or horses at a reasonable
rate.&nbsp; The H&ocirc;tel Grand Bretagne, just opposite the
palace&mdash;and a far finer building to look at&mdash;is about
as good a hotel as I was ever in.&nbsp; The rooms seem awfully
dark as you enter from the glare of the ever-shining sun, but the
rooms are lofty, well ventilated, and everywhere you have marble
floors and marble columns, and the feeding is good, considering
what a parched-up land Greece is, and how dried-up its beef and
skinny its poultry.&nbsp; I have seen cheaper hotels in Athens,
such as the H&ocirc;tel des Iles Ionienic, the proprietor of
which, a Greek from Corfu, strongly recommended it to me; but on
the whole, in such a place as Athens, I should think it
preferable to pay a little more for the comfort of a first-class
hotel, even though it may make one indifferent to the
&lsquo;Laurels&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Cedars&rsquo; of his own
native land.</p>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>How to
live rationally is an art the majority of Englishmen have not yet
acquired.&nbsp; I leave Athens with regret; its people are all
industrious.&nbsp; At any rate, there are no beggars in its
streets; and if this be the result of its democratic Government,
so much the better for the coming democracy, which, whether we
like it or not, is sure to rule at home.&nbsp; Here the
Government is popular, and the people are content.&nbsp;
Manufactures are almost unknown.&nbsp; They have a woollen
factory at Athens, and a cotton-mill in the Pir&aelig;us, and
there must be a busy agricultural population, as a good deal of
the land between the Pir&aelig;us and the capital is laid out in
market-gardens.&nbsp; I am troubled as I think of our great
cities, with their vices and slums.&nbsp; I hold, with the poet,
God made the country and man the town.</p>
<p>It is a chequered history, that of Athens.&nbsp; Once it was
occupied by the Goths.&nbsp; The Romans fortified it; but the
ancient walls, which had been strengthened by Sylla, were unequal
to its defence, and the barbarians became masters of the noble
seats of the Muses and the Arts.&nbsp; Zosimus tells us that the
walls of Athens were guarded by the goddess Minerva, with her
formidable &aelig;gis, and by the angry phantom of Achilles, and
that the conqueror was dismayed by the presence of the hostile
gods of Greece.&nbsp; Yet, nevertheless, Alaric a second time
mastered the city by means of his barbarian troops.&nbsp; It is
wonderful that any remains of the Athens of its prime
exist.&nbsp; As it is, it requires a good deal of enthusiasm to
&lsquo;do&rsquo; its ruins, with which photography has long made
the world familiar.&nbsp; The glory of the Parthenon, however,
remains.&nbsp; Gibbon tells us in the sack of Athens the Goths
had collected <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>all the libraries, and were about to set fire to them,
when one of the chiefs, of more refined policy than his brethren,
dissuaded them from the design by the profound observation that
as long as the Greeks were exercised in the study of books they
would never apply themselves to the exercise of arms.&nbsp; But,
as Gibbon writes, the Gothic arms were less fatal to the schools
of Athens than the establishment of a new religion, whose masters
resolved every question into an article of faith, and condemned
the infidel to eternal flames.&nbsp; For centuries Athens had
flourished by means of her schools.&nbsp; After the settlement of
the Roman Empire, it was filled with scholars from every part of
the known world, even including students from Britain.&nbsp; In
the suburbs of the city tradition still lingered of the Academy
of the Platonists, the Lyc&aelig;um of the Peripatetics, the
Portico of the Stoics, and the Garden of Epicurus.&nbsp; The
Attic schools of rhetoric and philosophy maintained their
reputation from the Peloponnesian war to the reign of
Justinian.&nbsp; It was he who suppressed the school which had
given so many sages to mankind, and whose influences have
quickened and invigorated the human intellect ever since.&nbsp;
The art of oratory may soon be held to be almost a doubtful
boon&mdash;at any rate, so far as senates and parliaments are
concerned.&nbsp; It was not so when the eloquence of
Demosthenes</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;shook
the arsenal,<br />
And fulmined over Greece.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of my fellow-passengers made their way to Eleusis, but
they came back disappointed, and covered with dust.&nbsp; It was
enough for me to study the life of the streets&mdash;full of
soldiers and black-robed priests.</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>The
traveller who, remembering the long period of Turkish sway,
counts on receiving an Oriental impression from the aspect of
Athens is doomed to disappointment.&nbsp; Even the national garb
is fast disappearing.&nbsp; It may still be worn by a few elderly
Athenians.&nbsp; These, and a peasant here and there selling milk
or cheese, recall the day when their dress was the national
one.&nbsp; The wide blue trousers of the &AElig;gean islanders
are not less rare, nor is there much chance of seeing them at the
Pir&aelig;us, among the craft from the various islands moored
along the quays.&nbsp; The uglier and cheaper product of the
slop-shop has replaced the picturesque drapery of the olden
time.</p>
<p>Sooner or later Athens is sure to become a winter resort not
less favoured than any on the Mediterranean, and the permanent
home of many foreigners.&nbsp; The opinion thus confidently
expressed is strengthened by the fact that few who have lived for
some length of time within its gates pass out of them without
regret, or fail to re-enter them with pleasure.&nbsp; At any
rate, so writes a learned American.</p>
<p>A gentleman has written explaining that Greece is bankrupt
because she is so small.&nbsp; He says that out of 5,000,000
Greeks who rose in 1821 against the Turk, less than 1,000,000
were allowed to form part of the Hellenic kingdom.&nbsp; The
obvious reply to this is, Why don&rsquo;t they go and live in
Greece if they really want to?&nbsp; Nobody forces them to live
elsewhere, and they can hardly be waiting till Constantinople,
Asia Minor and Cyprus are added to King George&rsquo;s
kingdom.&nbsp; The truth is that in business Greek would rather
not meet Greek; there is more money in meeting somebody
else.&nbsp; The rich Greeks will always be found outside
Greece.</p>
<h2><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">CONSTANTINOPLE.</p>
<p>I am in Constantinople, founded 658 <span
class="smcap">b.c.</span> by Byza, King of Megara, after whom it
was called Byzantium.&nbsp; After some hundreds of years it fell
into the hands of the Romans, who, like the Scotch, kept
everything they could lay their hands on; and then came
Constantine the Great, whose mother, some people say, lived in
East Anglia, who enlarged and beautified the city, built the
Hippodrome (one of the wonders of the place), and would have made
it the capital of his enormous empire.&nbsp; No one can blame the
Emperor for preferring Constantinople to Rome.</p>
<p>The city soon became worthy to be the seat of empire.&nbsp; It
commanded from its seven hills the opposite shores of Asia and
Europe.&nbsp; The climate was healthy, the soil fertile, and the
harbour capacious and secure.&nbsp; The Bosphorus and the
Hellespont were its two gates, which could always be shut against
a hostile fleet.&nbsp; A hundred years after its foundation, a
writer, quoted by Gibbon, describes it as possessing a school of
learning, a circus, two theatres, eight public and a hundred and
fifty-three private baths, fifty-two porticos, five granaries,
eight aqueducts, four spacious halls for the meetings <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>of the senate
and courts of justice, fourteen churches, fourteen palaces, and
four thousand three hundred private houses, which from their size
and beauty deserved to be distinguished from the multitude of
plebeian buildings.&nbsp; Successive wars and invasions impaired
the wealth and the magnificence of the city.&nbsp; Of the time of
Constantine little remains but the ruins of the Hippodrome.&nbsp;
The Christian Church of St. Sophia, which he erected to the
Eternal Wisdom, and from the pulpit of which Gregory of Nazianzen
and Chrysostom the golden-mouthed thundered, was burnt in the
reign of Justinian, and his Church of St. Sophia is now a Turkish
mosque.&nbsp; The city was the seat and centre of the
controversies originated in Alexandria as to the nature of the
Trinity, and its rival factions, the Greens and the Blues, were
ever ready to engage in bloody and disastrous conflict.&nbsp; As
a rule, a man&rsquo;s zeal is according to his ignorance, and at
Constantinople the meanest mechanics spent most of their time in
discussing mysteries of which the acutest intellects can never
even form an adequate idea, and which no human creed can properly
define and express.&nbsp; The Crusaders, who knew little of these
matters, seem to have been quite awestruck when they made their
way to Constantinople.&nbsp; &lsquo;That such a city could be in
the world,&rsquo; writes one of the old chroniclers, &lsquo;they
had never conceived, and they were never weary of staring at the
high walls and towers with which it was entirely compassed; the
rich palaces and lofty churches, of which there were so many that
no one could have believed it if he had not seen with his own
eyes that city&mdash;the queen of all cities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There are few places naturally so picturesque&mdash;no city <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>where the
suburbs are so charming.&nbsp; One never wearies of Scutari,
Gallipoli, washed by the splendid waters of the Sea of Marmora,
the Bosphorus, or those of that magnificent harbour, the Golden
Horn, which extends eight miles, and affords an anchorage for a
fleet of twelve hundred vessels.&nbsp; Indeed, whether viewed
from sea or land, or from such a wonderful standpoint as the
marble tower of the Seraskierat, Constantinople on its seven
hills, divided as it were between Europe and Asia, presents a
marvellous display of scenic beauty.&nbsp; You gaze on stately
white palaces, surrounded by domes, towers, cupolas, standing
amidst tier above tier of many-coloured dwellings, surrounded on
all sides by graceful masses of dark cypresses and sombre
pines.&nbsp; High above all rises the grand marble mosque of St.
Sophia, resplendent with mosaics, and sending up heavenwards its
lofty minarets, whence five times a day the cry of the muezzin
calls the world to prayer.&nbsp; As you look and admire, you
feel, with the poet,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;That every prospect pleases,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And only man is vile&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that is, ever since the Turk has been there.&nbsp; And thus it
appears that Constantinople has been, socially and politically, a
centre of abominations.&nbsp; It was in 1453 that Mahomet II.
took it as his own, and it is there that the unspeakable Turk has
ever since remained, and mainly in consequence of English
diplomacy and the prodigal expenditure of English treasure and
blood.&nbsp; The climax was reached in the days of Lord Stratford
de Redcliffe&mdash;the Great Elchi, as he was termed.&nbsp; He
insisted on reforms, and the Sultan granted them.&nbsp; He
insisted that all religions should be equal in the eye of the
law, and the precious boon was at once declared.&nbsp;

</a><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>Under
the pressure of the Great Elchi, the Sultan issued a
proclamation, stating his desire of renewing and enlarging the
numerous improvements suggested in his institutions, with a view
of making them worthy of the place which his empire held among
civilized nations.&nbsp; He was anxious, he said, to promote the
happiness of his people, who in his sight were all equal and
equally dear.&nbsp; &lsquo;Every distinction or designation
tending to make any class of subjects of my empire inferior to
any other class on account of their religion, language, or race
shall be for ever effaced.&rsquo;&nbsp; No one was to be hindered
in future on account of his religious creed; no one was to be
compelled to change his religion.&nbsp; Such was the spirit of
the famous <i>hatti Humayun</i> of 1856.&nbsp; Then came the
Treaty of Paris, to destroy the influence of England in the
East.&nbsp; The French cared nothing for Turkish reform, and have
cared nothing ever since.&nbsp; Bulgarian atrocities, murder and
massacre in Cyprus, murder and massacre on a larger scale in
Armenia or wherever Armenians are gathered together&mdash;of
these things the gay world of Paris takes little heed, except
when an occasion offers to sneer at John Bull.&nbsp; What cares
La Belle France, so long as it has its boulevards and theatres,
for the deadly sufferings of any nationality?&nbsp; When did it
ever fight for men and women dying by the thousand&mdash;ay, tens
of thousands, under the despotic sway of a Sultan Abdul
Hamid?&nbsp; France does not fight; its aim is to sneer at others
and to glorify itself, to make better people as heartless, as
cynical, as frivolous as itself.&nbsp; And are we much
better&mdash;we, whose people, and nobles, and courtiers, and
statesmen, and princes, have just done throwing themselves under
the feet of

Czar?&nbsp; Yes, but John Bull can act when he has a
mind&mdash;that is, when he has his inferiors to deal with.&nbsp;
It was beautiful when we brought Greece on her knees over the Don
Pacifico affair!&nbsp; How bitterly we made China pay for her
attack on the <i>Arrow</i>!&nbsp; How we settled the would-be
Sultan of Zanzibar!&nbsp; How we have smitten the Dervishes hip
and thigh!&nbsp; When I was in Ceylon, I had an interesting
interview with Arabi Pasha.&nbsp; I left him hoping, and that is
what we all do as regards Turkish affairs&mdash;hoping for what
never comes.</p>
<p>In the Dardanelles we make our first acquaintance with the
Turk.&nbsp; He arrives in a small steamer, with a crew of men
wearing the red fez, and at the stern of his boat floats the red
flag of Turkey, bearing the crescent.&nbsp; He gives us
permission to pursue our way past the forts on either side at the
mouth and along the Dardanelles, at the entrance to which point
are lying off on our right the far-famed plains of windy
Troy.&nbsp; I see also a couple of ironclads, but of what
nationality I cannot exactly make out.&nbsp; We are soon out of
the Dardanelles, and at Gallipoli, the last town on the European
side, and we enter the Sea of Marmora.&nbsp; In current language,
Constantinople includes Stamboul, Galata, and its suburbs, which
stretch up both sides of the Bosphorus.&nbsp; Galata, the
mercantile and shipping quarter, occupies the point and slopes at
the right-hand side of the Golden Horn.</p>
<p>Constantinople looks best at a distance.&nbsp; It is true here
that distance lends enchantment to the view.&nbsp; Outside it
glitters with magnificence.&nbsp; Inside it is foul and beastly,
with pavements detestable to walk along or drive, with ruins at
every corner, and with refuse

</a><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>lying
to fester in the blazing sun all day long&mdash;certainly a
remarkable illustration of what Lord Palmerston affirmed, that
dirt was only matter in the wrong place.&nbsp; If you drive you
are choked with dust, and the streets are by no means broad
enough for the constant business and bustle.&nbsp; Enter the
mosques, and you are astonished at their grandeur and the air of
desolation and neglect all round.&nbsp; On the waters you miss
the gay caique, now superseded by the steam-ferries, ever
vomiting clouds of sulphurous smoke.&nbsp; In the city you see
the tramcar, a very shabby one, doing a roaring trade.&nbsp; Down
by the harbour you see the police, well armed and in small
detachments, carefully guarding the streets.&nbsp; The men, with
the exception of the red fez, mostly wear the European
costume.&nbsp; The women you see in the streets are old and ugly,
and, happily, veiled, so that you see nothing of their ugliness
but the nose and eyes.&nbsp; Some of the little urchins and girls
are very bright-looking, but I fancy they are mostly
Greeks.&nbsp; The Turkish boy of the middle class seemed to me
very heavy, but, however that may be, he develops into a fine
man, with a grand dark face and powerful nose, and looks
especially well when on his Arab steed&mdash;small, but active
and strong, as if he were born to drive everyone before
him.&nbsp; Alas! in his little shop he seems very listless and
apathetic, but the man in the street is very pertinacious, and I
have just bought an elegant walking-stick for half a crown, after
being asked four shillings, which I hold to be the cheapest
bargain I have made for some time.</p>
<p>We are quite mistaken in England as to the safety of walking
the streets in Constantinople.&nbsp; I heard of a row last night,
but by day the streets are quite as <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>secure as they are in London.&nbsp;
One thing that astonishes me is the utter ignorance of the people
of what is going on outside respecting Turkish affairs, and the
action, if any, of the diplomatists.&nbsp; You never hear a word
on the subject.&nbsp; To sell seems to be the only aim of the
Turk.&nbsp; The shops are prodigious.&nbsp; In London their
owners would be a great middle class, and form an enlightened
public opinion.&nbsp; Here they do nothing of the kind, and there
is not a street that has a decent pavement nor a corner that is
not a dunghill.&nbsp; There seems to be no attempt at
improvement.&nbsp; The dogs&mdash;very much like Australian
dingoes&mdash;bark and bite all day and howl all night.&nbsp;
Confusion and decay seem to reign paramount.&nbsp; Now and then
you come to an open space&mdash;as at the old slave-market, the
mosques, and the Hippodrome, where a few trees, chiefly acacias,
manage to live, and then you plunge into Holywell Street as it
existed half a century back, and all is darkness and dirt
again.</p>
<p>Constantinople seems to live chiefly on corn imported from
Roumelia and Bulgaria; but they say they are going to open up
Asia Minor by means of railways, and the wheat-grower there will
then have his chance.&nbsp; There are few liquor-shops, but many
for the sale of lemon-and-water and grapes and melons.&nbsp; In
many a shop I see Sunlight Soap and the biscuits of Huntley and
Palmer and Peek and Frean.&nbsp; The donkeys and horses have an
awful time of it as they go along the narrow streets, with
panniers on each side, which appear to get in everyone&rsquo;s
way.&nbsp; Then comes a rickety waggon, drawn by two big oxen,
which seem as if they must grind the pedestrian to powder.&nbsp;
Then follows the porter, perspiring and bending under his <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>heavy load,
and the aged crone, more or less veiled, as if she
had&mdash;which she has not, unhappily&mdash;a glimpse of female
charm to display.&nbsp; Now and then you meet a priest with his
red-and-white turban and long brown robe, and if you make your
way into a mosque&mdash;and they are all worth
visiting&mdash;there, in a little wooden recess, seated
cross-legged on an Indian mat, you will find a priest or devout
layman by himself, repeating verses of the Koran.&nbsp; The
mosques are grotesque outside, but inspiring from their size
inside.</p>
<p>Constantinople is not the place to come to on a hot November
day, and the commercial port is, I hold, utterly unfit for
shipping.&nbsp; We have a good deal of diarrhoea on board, nor
can you wonder, when you remember that into this one spot flows
all the filth and sewage of Galata.&nbsp; It is worse than
Naples; it is worse than Athens, and that is saying a good
deal.&nbsp; Coleridge&rsquo;s Cologne, with its numerous
stenches, is nothing to it.&nbsp; If there be any truth in
sanitary science, there must be an awful waste of life in these
parts.&nbsp; Here we hear not a whisper of the Turkish crisis, or
of the driving out of the Turk, &lsquo;bag and baggage,&rsquo; as
Lord Stratford de Redcliffe wrote fifty years before Mr.
Gladstone adopted the celebrated phrase.&nbsp; Be that as it may,
Constantinople gives you an idea of a densely-populated
city.&nbsp; It is with real difficulty that you make your way
anywhere.&nbsp; The fat official Turk, who dines in some gorgeous
palace&mdash;and the place is full of them&mdash;and drives in
his brougham and pair, may have an easy time of it; but the
majority of the inhabitants, in their narrow shops and darkened
houses, must have a bad time of it.&nbsp; I sigh for the wings of
a dove, that I may fly away and be at rest.&nbsp; Under this
pestiferous <a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>atmosphere and bright, blazing sun, it is impossible to
do anything but sleep; but that is not easy in one&rsquo;s small
cabin, floating on this wide waste of sewage.&nbsp; There seems
nothing to amuse the people.&nbsp; In the course of my
peregrinations I met with but one minstrel, and he was far
away.&nbsp; Next to the mosques, the coolest place I have yet
visited is the new museum, with a

</a>fine collection of Greek and Roman and Egyptian antiquities;
but I am no friend to a hurried visit to a museum, which leaves
the mind rather confused and uninformed.&nbsp; As yet I have made
no attempt to penetrate into the mysteries of the harem.&nbsp;
For one thing, I am rather past that sort of thing.&nbsp; But if
I may judge from what I have seen outside the harem, there can be
but little to tempt one to enter within; and <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>with the poet
I exclaim, &lsquo;Where ignorance is bliss, &rsquo;tis folly to
be wise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I fancy we are most of us tired of Constantinople.&nbsp; To me
it is a place where a little sight-seeing goes a long way.&nbsp;
Our gallant captain, on the contrary, tells me that he could put
in three months here very well.&nbsp; As it is, there are about
2,000 English here, to say nothing of naturalized Greeks and
Maltese.&nbsp; I suppose Constantinople is not a bad place for a
short residence.&nbsp; The hotels are good, and in some you may
have a bedroom for four francs a day.&nbsp; Provisions are not
dear, but house-rent is very expensive.&nbsp; The population of
the place is dense, at which I wonder, as Constantinople seems to
me the most unhealthy city I have ever seen.&nbsp; The only
nuisances are the guides, who will persist in following you
everywhere, and whose knowledge of English and of the things you
really want to know is very limited.&nbsp; For instance, I passed
two obelisks one day.&nbsp; I asked my guide about them.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They come from Egypt,&rsquo; was his reply.&nbsp; I could
have told him as much myself.</p>
<p>If you need rest, seek it not in Constantinople, with its
noisy crowds by day and its noisy dogs by night; seek it not in
its narrow streets, where horses and asses and big bullocks,
dragging along the most rickety of waggons, are ever to be seen;
seek it not as you drive along its uneven and disgracefully-paved
streets.&nbsp; The mosques are cool and spacious&mdash;there you
may rest; but if there is a service, you are not permitted to
remain unless you are a Mohammedan.&nbsp; One advantage of the
mosques is that there is generally a large open space attached to
them, where people can wash themselves and also hold a
market.&nbsp; People seem to <a name="page67"></a><span

much as they like, as they talk and smoke and play cards, and
indulge in coffee or lemon-and-water.&nbsp; I have never yet seen
a drunken man or&mdash;what is worse&mdash;a drunken woman, and
yet an English lady, a clergyman&rsquo;s wife, told me that she
only went on shore once, and was so shocked that she resolved
never to set foot in the place again.&nbsp; The people were so
degraded; the poor porters were so overburdened; and, then, they
were all such awful idolaters.&nbsp; I presume the lady knows
nothing of parts of London where worse sights are to be seen
every day.</p>
<p>The Bosphorus is beautiful beyond description.&nbsp; It beats
the Rhine, it beats the American Hudson; indeed, it is the
grandest panorama in the world.&nbsp; At its back rise the green
wooded hills, and the front is lined with pleasant villas and
palaces&mdash;white or yellow, built in Turkish fashion, with
innumerable windows everywhere.&nbsp; There must be great wealth
in the district to build and support such places.&nbsp;
Everywhere there is a great appearance of religion.&nbsp; Go into
a mosque any hour you will, and you see a priest or layman
sitting in a quiet corner, fenced with a wooden rail,
cross-legged, repeating the Koran.&nbsp; One of the oddest sights
I saw in the grand Mosque of St. Sophia was that of an
old-fashioned London clock.&nbsp; One of my troubles as I
explored the mosque&mdash;the floor of which is lined with Indian
matting&mdash;was to keep on my Turkish slippers.&nbsp; An
attendant who followed me had to stoop down every minute to put
them on, that I might not reveal the deck-shoes which I wore
inside.&nbsp; A gentleman who had visited the mosque told me that
on one occasion, when he took off a pair of new boots there which
he was wearing, he never saw them again.</p>
<p><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>It is
wonderful how cheap provisions are: beef, threepence a pound;
bread, a halfpenny; grapes, a halfpenny; fowls for sevenpence;
and mountains of melons everywhere.&nbsp; There is free
education, and an abundant supply of schools.&nbsp; The labouring
classes are well employed.&nbsp; The English here are chiefly
merchants or agents or engineers.&nbsp; On our way back we pass
that favourite resort of the Turkish holiday-makers&mdash;the
Valley of Sweet Waters&mdash;and have a good view of the hospital
at Scutari, built by Florence Nightingale&mdash;now utilized as
barracks&mdash;and of the monuments in front of the cemetery in
memory of the British officers and soldiers who died during the
Crimean War.</p>
<p>It is a relief to us all to get back into the Dardanelles and
sail over the spot where Xerxes built his famous bridge, the
narrow strait across which Leander swam nightly to visit his
lady-love&mdash;a feat performed by our great poet Byron at a
later age&mdash;and wander in fancy as we again catch sight of
the plains of Troy, the spot where the Greek hero Protesilaus
first struck the Trojan strand, and thus gave occasion to our
Wordsworth to write his immortal poem&mdash;a poem that will be
read and admired when all the puny poets of the present age are
dead and forgotten.&nbsp; Out in the &AElig;gean Sea the weather
is almost cool and delightfully refreshing, just like a fine
morning in spring at home.&nbsp; The first isle of any importance
we make is Tenedos, behind which, on the mainland, lies Troas,
visited by the Apostle Paul.&nbsp; To the north lies Besika Bay,
where once the French and English fleets assembled prior to their
passage of the Dardanelles, and where the British fleet, under
Admiral Hornby, lay in 1887&ndash;88 during the Russo-Turkish
War.&nbsp; Next we reach the <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>ancient Lectum, the most westernly
point of Asia, and get a glimpse of the beautiful island of
Mitylene, the ancient Lesbos.&nbsp; Mitylene, on the east coast,
is prettily situated, and does a considerable trade.&nbsp; There
are few remains of the ancient city.&nbsp; The island has 115,000
inhabitants, mostly Greeks.</p>
<h2><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">SMYRNA.</p>
<p>I write now from one of the most ancient cities in the
world.&nbsp; There is a wonderful lot of ancient history in these
parts.&nbsp; The mind quite staggers under the ever-accumulating
load of facts and figures and legends.&nbsp; The &AElig;olians,
who founded on this site the first Greek city, claimed it as the
birthplace of Homer.&nbsp; It was there that his poetry
flourished; then, under the successors of Alexander, it became
celebrated for its schools of science and medicine.&nbsp;
Christianity early made its way into Smyrna, which has enjoyed
the reputation of being one of the Seven Churches of Asia alluded
to in Revelation.&nbsp; It was there that Polycarp suffered
martyrdom, and it is there they still show you, or profess to
show you, his tomb.&nbsp; Defended by the Knights of Rhodes,
Smyrna fell when Timur, the terrible Mogul, appeared before it
and put all that breathed to the sword.&nbsp; As it was, I felt
satisfied and charmed with modern Smyrna, and did not climb the
hill behind on which stands the ruins of a castle, and where
brigands still lie in wait for the unwary traveller.&nbsp; Nor
did I take the train to Ephesus, a run of nearly two hours, to
wander under the hot sun and amidst the <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>rough winds
to see what remains, amidst bushes and rocks and cornfields, of
ancient Ephesus&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that there
Christian synods have been held, and that in a cave adjoining
slept those marvellous Seven Sleepers; that there stood the
temple of the goddess Diana, whose worshippers the great Apostle
of the Gentiles woke up to cry excitedly for the craft by which
they lived.&nbsp; It is a scene of desolation, which certainly
does not repay the ordinary tourist the trouble of a visit.</p>
<p>But I revelled in Smyrna&mdash;one of the brightest, cleanest,
and most prosperous cities under Turkish sway.&nbsp; Its white
houses, chiefly hotels and restaurants and theatres, line the
bay, with dense shipping in the forefront, while the mountains
behind, up the slopes of which modern Smyrna is gradually
planting herself, act as guard and shelter.&nbsp; At the time of
my visit there stretched across the bay quite an imposing display
of ironclads of all nations&mdash;American, English, Italian,
French&mdash;and it made me shudder to think of them bombarding
this scene of life and gaiety and spreading terror amongst its
hard-working people.&nbsp; A tramway runs along the whole front
of the city for about a couple of miles, and, as you stand
thinking of the wonders of modern civilization, you hear a bell
tinkle, and see half a dozen camels laden with sacks of grain
striding past, generally led by a man on a donkey.&nbsp;
Sometimes the donkey had no rider, and yet the patient camel
followed all the same.&nbsp; It was intensely amusing: the
contrast between the little donkey leading and the big camel
behind.&nbsp; It set me thinking of the many parallel passages in
modern history&mdash;of parties, Churches, States, led by
donkeys.&nbsp; Smyrna has <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>an enormous bazaar, into which it is
easier to find one&rsquo;s way than to get out.&nbsp; It has fine
mosques and handsome Greek churches.&nbsp; It shelters the ships
and people of all nations, but my chief delight was to watch the
string of camels as they ever came and went.&nbsp; Even in the
narrow passages of the bazaar there were the camels, and it was
all you could do to get out of the way of these grand animals,
for such they were.</p>

<p>One place that I visited much interested me.&nbsp; It was the
Sailors&rsquo; Rest on the quay, a fine room with a library and
reading-room, where the sailors come and go, and where they are
supplied with refreshments of a non-intoxicating character,
carried on in connection with the Greek Evangelical Alliance,
founded in Smyrna in 1883.&nbsp; Depression in business, and
consequent <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>poverty and other causes, such as the declining number
of British merchants who come to Smyrna, ousted, I presume, by
more enterprising rivals, and troubles in the interior, have
hindered the work, which, however, is successfully carried
on.&nbsp; The average attendance last year was: Sunday morning
service, 83; afternoon, 59; Tuesday prayer-meeting, 41; Gospel
service at the Rest, 50.&nbsp; At the Sunday-school the average
attendance has been about 60.&nbsp; Owing to the shifting
population of Smyrna, many of the church members have become
scattered in many lands.&nbsp; The bitterest enemies of the work
are the members of the Orthodox Greek Church, who have no
sympathy with an Evangelical Alliance of any kind, and care not a
rap for the union of the Churches.&nbsp; As an illustration, take
the following: &lsquo;In 1895 it was expected that the official
permit for the building of a chapel on a site assigned by
Government would be granted to the Evangelicals.&nbsp; In fact,
in the middle of January permission was granted for the opening
of the school, but the local authorities, desiring to avoid any
possible outbreak on the part of &lsquo;the Orthodox,&rsquo;
tried to bring about a friendly compromise.&nbsp; It was all in
vain, the Orthodox declaring that they would listen to no terms
unless the Evangelicals were entirely thrust out from the central
quarter of the town, and that they would never allow the chapel
to be built or the site prepared for it.&nbsp; Thus foiled, the
Evangelicals opened their school, but &lsquo;the Orthodox&rsquo;
attacked the building with stones, defacing it almost entirely,
and quite destroying all the furniture within.&nbsp; The result
was that the Evangelicals had to commence their labours anew
elsewhere.&nbsp; After two months&rsquo; labour the ire of the <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>Orthodox was
again aroused; they drove out the workmen, pulled down part of
the walls, and finally remained masters of the situation.&nbsp;
It is true that fifteen of the Orthodox were imprisoned, but the
Evangelicals were advised to leave the situation also, and to
remove to some other site more acceptable to their
opponents.&nbsp; This advice the Evangelicals refused to accept,
and, after a long delay, by the personal efforts and goodwill of
the new Turkish Governor the building was restored.&nbsp;
Orthodoxy seemed to be a sad stumbling-block in the way of good
work everywhere.&nbsp; The Sailors&rsquo; Rest at Smyrna may be
much aided by British Christians, both by presents of books or by
pecuniary contributions.&nbsp; During the last year it seems that
229 visits have been paid to ships, 64 bags of books sent out, 20
pledges taken.&nbsp; I fear there is a good deal of drunkenness
in Smyrna.&nbsp; Seven thousand six hundred visits have been made
in the year by sailors to the Rest, 797 have attended the
meetings, 676 Bibles, Testaments, and portions have been given
away, and many were the letters sent home by sailors from the
Rest.&nbsp; It seems to me that it might be kept open a little
later at night with advantage, as I find it is the fashion to
keep many of the drinking-shops open all night.&nbsp; The work
among the Greeks has been reviving, and it is regarded as
hopeful.&nbsp; The meetings are well attended, and especially so
the Wednesday evening meeting in the Corner Room at the
Rest.&nbsp; This meeting is described as the fishing-net of the
Greek work, as many of those who became regular attendants at the
other services held in the American Chapel began at the
Rest.&nbsp; At Smyrna our American fellow-passengers hear the
result of the Presidential <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>contest in America, and greatly
rejoice.&nbsp; Their country is saved&mdash;at any rate, this
time.&nbsp; Local lines of steamers run from Smyrna to Messina
and Beirut, touching at all the important coast towns and at
several of the islands, at which we have a peep, such as Cos, the
birthplace of Hippocrates; Halicarnassus, where Herodotus was
born, and where stood the famous mausoleum, one of the wonders of
the world; and Rhodes, far-famed.&nbsp; But we may not tarry even
in order to gratify such a laudable curiosity; no, not even at
Cyprus, which has prospered so much under English rule.&nbsp; It
is enough for us to have explored Smyrna, a city which in every
way, as regards cleanliness in the streets and the absence of
abominable smells, is a great improvement on
Constantinople.&nbsp; It has a population of nearly half a
million, of which less than one-fourth is Moslem, and more than
half Greek.&nbsp; There are large Armenian and Jewish colonies,
that of the Jews, of course, being the most squalid, unhealthy
and debased.&nbsp; The town is governed by a municipality.&nbsp;
Europeans are under the jurisdiction of their consuls.&nbsp; Its
gas lights beamed on us brilliantly as we steamed out in the dark
into the open sea.&nbsp; The one nuisance of Smyrna are the boys,
who go to learn English at the schools taught by the
missionaries, and these persistently pester you to be taken on as
guides.&nbsp; The professional guides are nuisance enough, but
these boys are infinitely worse.</p>
<h2><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">JAFFA TO JERUSALEM.</p>
<p>You see nothing of Jerusalem till you get inside the city, and
to enjoy a visit requires a greater enthusiasm than any to which
I can lay claim.&nbsp; We were safely landed at Jaffa, which by
this time ought to have a more decent landing-place; thence,
after a glance at the house where Simon the Tanner carried on
business, I made my way&mdash;along tortuous roads, more or less
blocked with stones and rubbish, and more or less exposed to a
burning sun&mdash;to the station, whence we were to start for
Jerusalem, a hot ride of nearly four hours in railway-carriages
of very second-rate quality.&nbsp; The land about Jaffa is
fertile and well cultivated; fig-trees and olive-trees and
orange-groves are abundant, and at Jaffa the chief business
seemed to be packing them in boxes for export.&nbsp; At one
particular spot our conductor told us that it was there that
Samson set the cornfields of the Philistines on fire.&nbsp;
Certainly the ground seemed dry and baked up enough.&nbsp; Then
Arithmea was reached.&nbsp; On our way we got our first sight of
a native village, built of mud huts, into which it seemed
difficult to find an entrance.&nbsp; A Kaffir village is
infinitely to be preferred.&nbsp; The scene of desolation <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>was
complete.&nbsp; On the neighbouring rocks nothing was to be seen
but flocks of goats.&nbsp; A little fairer scene opened on us as
we passed the neat German colony that has settled down here,
almost under the shadow of the walls of Jerusalem.&nbsp; Then the
terminus is gained, and we are whirled in a cloud of dust, in
rickety carriages, driven by their hoarsely-shouting drivers at
full gallop, all of us white as millers, being clothed with
dust.&nbsp; I wash at Howard&rsquo;s Hotel, swallow a cup of tea,
and, as we do not dine till six, make my way into Jerusalem by
the Jaffa Gate.&nbsp; A little of Jerusalem goes a long
way.&nbsp; It is dark and stifling, swarming with people and
camels and asses, and noisy beyond description.&nbsp; A sort of
Rag Fair, only with a few touches of the East, such as a veiled
woman, or a stately Turk in turban and flowing robes, or a
black-coated, black-bearded Greek priest, or a low row of
shopkeepers, sitting patiently in their dark and tiny shops,
thrown in.&nbsp; You must keep moving, or you will be run over by
a donkey or a camel, for, as the country round Jerusalem grows
nothing, the necessaries of life have all to be brought from a
distance.&nbsp; My respected countrymen and countrywomen are in a
state of gush all the while, not to be wondered at when you think
of the Jerusalem of David, and Solomon, and Jesus Christ.&nbsp;
As it is in reality, I own I see very little to gush about.&nbsp;
I reach the Via Dolorosa&mdash;there is no trace of Christ there;
I pass the Church of the Sepulchre and the mosque which marks the
site where Solomon built his Temple.&nbsp; I think of the royal
Psalmist who here poured forth the wailings of his heart in
language which has formed the penitential chant of all the
ages.&nbsp; But if I would see the Christ I must get out of this
<a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>city, all
crammed with lies and living upon lies.&nbsp; I muse by myself in
the Garden of Gethsemane; I climb the Mount of Olives.&nbsp; It
is outside the city, away from

Calvary, and feel how true it is that</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Each soul redeemed from sin and death<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must know its Calvary.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>I have
had enough of Jerusalem.&nbsp; My fellow-travellers leave me to
go to Jericho.&nbsp; I have no wish to be sent to Jericho, and
prefer to remain under the grateful shelter of my hotel, just
outside the Jaffa Gate.&nbsp; What strikes me most is the
prosperity of the place.&nbsp; It is growing fast, in spite of
Turkish rule.&nbsp; The people are robbed by the tax-collectors;
nevertheless, the place gains, and the population outside the
city walls is quite as great as that within.&nbsp; One reason, of
course, is that wealthy Christians in England and America spend
large sums of money in keeping up proselytizing establishments
here, and in erecting fine buildings for the same end.&nbsp; Of
course we have a Bishop here, but he is High Church, and seems,
from all I hear, more inclined to bridge over the gulf between
his Church and the Greek than to promote general and
undenominational Christian work.&nbsp; The number of poor Jews is
enormous.&nbsp; They come here from all parts of the world to die
in the Sacred City, and have many charities established on their
behalf.&nbsp; The Britisher has this advantage&mdash;that he pays
no taxes.&nbsp; The Jew is not permitted to hold a bit of land
unless he has been a resident here five years.&nbsp; The Turk
holds Jerusalem to be a sacred city only second to Mecca.&nbsp;
No wonder, then, that the nations have fought bitterly for the
possession of its so-called sacred shrines; no wonder that
Christians from all parts of the world hasten to Jerusalem, and
that you meet in the streets and shops and hotels such a mixture
of men and women&mdash;brought by excursion-parties from
London&mdash;as, perhaps, you have never seen before, and,

ever been so.&nbsp; Those old Crusaders must have been rather a
mixed lot.&nbsp; As it is, <a name="page81"></a><span

Russian Church seems most in evidence.&nbsp; It has spent,
apparently, a great deal of money in building purposes.&nbsp; Its
new church, half-way up the Mount of Olives, is one of the finest
buildings to be seen outside the walls.&nbsp; The Russian is
wily; he knows what he is about&mdash;at any rate, better than
many of his rivals in the race for empire.</p>
<p>I think most of my party are getting tired of
Jerusalem&mdash;even the clergy, of whom we have many.&nbsp;
Exertion of any kind is painful on these dusty highways and under
this blazing sun.&nbsp; There has been no rain for six months,
and the Jews in the synagogue are praying for it daily, and yet
it seems as far off as ever.&nbsp; One thing that is really
enjoyable is the cool splendour of these cloudless skies by
night.&nbsp; I have seen the moon rise in many lands, but
never&mdash;no, not even under the Southern Cross&mdash;a moon so
full, so fair, so bright, as that of Jud&aelig;a, as it throws
its silvery light over old walls and peasants&rsquo; huts, on
hill and dale&mdash;I may not say ancient ruins, for all is new
outside Jerusalem, and as regards most of the city a similar
remark may be made.&nbsp; For Saracen and Roman have devastated
and destroyed entirely the real Jerusalem, which is now only
being disinterred by the labours of the agents of the Palestine
Exploration Fund, of whom Dr. Bliss is the chief.</p>
<p>The Jews preponderate everywhere, apparently poor and
depressed.&nbsp; The real Turk, sleek and well robed, is an
imposing figure, but the dragomans&mdash;chiefly Greeks, or of
the Greek Church&mdash;are active and intelligent, and very ready
to use their English, of which, apparently, they have but an
imperfect knowledge.&nbsp; The Jews speak the common dialect of
the country, but are <a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>taught Hebrew in the many schools
established for their benefit.&nbsp; The food displayed in their
cook-shops is, however, by no means tempting, and nowhere, unless
it be at such an international hotel as that of Chevalier Howard,
is the commissariat department very strong.&nbsp; But we have
clean, cool, delightful bedrooms.&nbsp; And Mr. Chevalier himself
is a remarkably intelligent and active man, and offers the
traveller facilities for excursions such as he can find nowhere
else.&nbsp; When one thinks of Palestine and the place it fills
in the world&rsquo;s history, it is hard to realize what a small
extent of country it contains.&nbsp; Its length is about 200
miles, and its average breadth 75 miles.&nbsp; On one side is the
Mediterranean Sea, and on the other the desert plain of
Arabia.&nbsp; A mountain range runs through it from north to
south.&nbsp; Its chief rivers are the Jordan, the Litany, the
Abana, and the Pharpar.&nbsp; I fancy it is better to come here
in the spring than in the autumn.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">THE HOLY CITY.</p>
<p>The three principal sights in Jerusalem are the Mosque of
Omar, now standing on the site of Solomon&rsquo;s Temple, the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and the Muristan, which is the
conglomerate remains of numerous edifices raised on the same spot
in the course of ages, from Charlemagne to Saladin, but named
from the madhouse built there by the Knights of St. John of
Jerusalem.&nbsp; The Church of the Holy Sepulchre should be
visited in the sunniest part of the day, as the interior is
awfully dark.&nbsp; It may be that it is what it assumes to
be.&nbsp; There are people who doubt this, as they do everything;
but here countless pilgrims in all ages have come to pray and
weep, and have kissed every stone and shrine to be seen within
the sacred precincts.&nbsp; I have read somewhere how a young
lady from the country came to town to hear the immortal Siddons,
then in the zenith of her fame.&nbsp; As soon as the performance
began, the young lady began to weep immediately.&nbsp; &lsquo;If
you weep in this way,&rsquo; said a gentleman to her, &lsquo;you
will have no tears to shed when the real Siddons
appears.&rsquo;&nbsp; The same feeling occurs to you in
Jerusalem.&nbsp; One is never sure that <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>the people
are wailing and weeping at the right place.&nbsp; People seem
there so much taken up with the dead Christ that they are
actually in danger of forgetting the living one, who speaks to us
to-day as when He lifted up His Divine voice in the crowded
streets of Jerusalem or beneath the proud pillars of the Temple
itself.</p>
<p>The question has long been discussed whether the traditional
site on which stands the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is the true
one.&nbsp; The matter turns upon the course of the city walls in
the time of Christ.&nbsp; All are agreed that wherever the
sepulchre was, it was without the gate, and not within
Jerusalem.&nbsp; From the Gospels we learn that the tomb was
rock-hewn, and that it was nigh the place of the
Crucifixion.&nbsp; Major Conder&rsquo;s excavations have almost
conclusively proved that the traditional site was without the
circuit of the city wall, and though the point cannot be
considered as quite settled, there are very strong grounds for
believing that the site was elsewhere.&nbsp; By the common
consent of experts, the true site has been found a short distance
north-east from the Damascus gate of the present city on the
rocky knoll immediately above the Jeremiah Grotto of our Bible
map.&nbsp; Indirectly, the so-called Jeremiah Grotto contributes
some support to the modern identification.&nbsp; It is the spot
where executions by stoning were carried out.&nbsp; The locality
General Gordon brought into notice as the Holy Sepulchre seems to
be quite unfounded.&nbsp; Major Conder points out that the tomb
was no new discovery when the General was in Jerusalem&mdash;that
it is probably not a Jewish tomb at all, and may be assigned to
the middle ages.</p>
<p><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>It is a
wonderful city, this old Jerusalem.&nbsp; It was here Solomon
built his Temple a thousand years before Christ.&nbsp; This
structure was subsequently destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar, rebuilt
by Zorobabel, and afterwards by Herod.&nbsp; Then came Titus and
the Romans, who left the city a desolation.&nbsp; Of all its
stateliness&mdash;the populous streets, the palaces of the kings,
the fortresses of her warriors&mdash;not a ruin remains, except
three tall towers and part of the western wall, which was left
for the defence of the Roman camp.&nbsp; From a Roman point of
view, Titus had well earned the honour of a triumph.</p>
<p>Of course in this connection one falls back on Gibbon:
&lsquo;In the midst of a rocky and barren country the walls of
Jerusalem inclosed the two mountains of Sion and Acra within an
oval figure of about three miles.&nbsp; Towards the south the
upper town and the fortress of David were erected on the lofty
ascent of Mount Zion; on the north side the buildings of the
lower town covered the spacious summit of Mount Acra, and a part
of the hill distinguished by the name of Moriah, and levelled by
human industry, was crowned with the stately temple of the Jewish
nation.&nbsp; After the final destruction of the temple by the
arms of Titus and Hadrian a ploughshare was drawn over the
consecrated ground, as a sign of perpetual interdiction.&nbsp;
Sion was deserted, and the vacant space of the lower city was
filled with the public and private edifices which spread
themselves over the adjacent hill of Calvary.&nbsp; The holy
places were polluted with monuments of idolatry; and, either from
design or accident, a chapel was dedicated to Venus on the spot
which had been sanctified by the death and resurrection <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>of
Christ.&nbsp; Almost 300 years after these stupendous events the
profane chapel of Venus was demolished by the order of
Constantine, and the removal of the earth and stone revealed the
Holy Sepulchre to the eyes of mankind.&nbsp; A magnificent church
was erected on that mystic ground by the first Christian emperor;
and the effects of his pious munificence were extended to every
spot which had been consecrated by the footsteps of patriarchs
and prophets and the Son of God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Admirably Gibbon puts the case.&nbsp; Nevertheless, from that
praiseworthy zeal on the part of Constantine, innumerable woes
and awful demoralization have ensued.&nbsp; The history of
Jerusalem has been dark and dolorous ever since.&nbsp; The
priests reaped a golden harvest, and found a believing generation
ever ready to accept even the most marvellous of their
statements, the Empress Helena leading the way.&nbsp; The clergy
made the most of these devout pilgrimages, and exhibited their
powers of invention on an enormous scale.&nbsp; The more the
pilgrims demanded, the greater the supply.&nbsp; The clergy fixed
the scene of each memorable event.&nbsp; They exhibited the
instruments which had been used in the passion of Christ: the
nails and the lance that had pierced His hands, His feet, and His
side; the crown of thorns that was planted on His head; the
pillar at which he was scourged; and, above all, they showed the
cross on which He had suffered&mdash;dug miraculously out of the
ground!&nbsp; It seems to us impossible that the credulity of
people could ever have been so great; but, alas! there are no
miracles or traditions which devoted men and women are unable to
swallow.&nbsp; Such miracles as seemed necessary found ample
credence.</p>
<p><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>&lsquo;The custody of the <i>true cross</i>, which on
Easter Tuesday,&rsquo; writes Gibbon, &lsquo;was solemnly exposed
to the people, was intrusted to the Bishop of Jerusalem; and he
alone might gratify the curious devotion of the pilgrims by the
gift of small pieces, which they enchased in gold or gems, and
carried away in triumph to their respective countries.&nbsp; But
as this gainful branch of commerce must soon have been
annihilated, it was found convenient to suppose that the
marvellous wood possessed a secret power of vegetation, and that
its substance, though continually diminished, still remained
entire and unimpaired.&rsquo;&nbsp; That is enough.&nbsp; It is
unnecessary to carry our investigations any further.&nbsp; The
only relics in which I could believe were the spurs of that grand
old crusader, Godfrey of Bouillon.&nbsp; In that city of
pretended sanctity, with its doubtful hallowed ground, it does
one good to think of Campbell&rsquo;s vigorous lines, never more
applicable than now:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;To incantations dost thou trust,<br />
And pompous rites in domes august?<br />
See, mouldering stone and metal&rsquo;s rust<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Belie the vaunt<br />
That man can bless one pile of dust<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With chime or chaunt.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Be that as it may, all steps in Jerusalem are dogged with
doubt.&nbsp; You hear a great deal more than you can
believe.&nbsp; We tread on ruins and know what they are,&mdash;so
far we can believe their testimony.&nbsp; Yet the city is full of
surpassing interest.&nbsp; &lsquo;After Rome,&rsquo; writes Dr.
Russell Forbes, in his valuable little work, &lsquo;The Holy
City: its Topography, Walls, and Temples,&rsquo; &lsquo;there is
no city which appeals to the feelings like Jerusalem; the
sympathy is deeper and stronger than that of Athens, which we
place third on the list.&nbsp; As <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>the sympathy towards the Eternal City
is derived from profane history, so as it were in opposition,
one&rsquo;s feelings toward the Holy City owe their origin to
sacred history.&nbsp; These two cities, sacred and profane, stand
out boldly on the world&rsquo;s surface like the figures in
Titian&rsquo;s celebrated picture&mdash;one appealing to the sun,
the other to the wind.&nbsp; The sacred is more ancient than the
profane, and the wind of controversy has swept equally over both,
while the spade of modern science has in each case confounded the
sceptic and established the truth of the unbroken records of the
past.&rsquo;&nbsp; That is putting the case rather
strongly.&nbsp; At any rate, in studying the topography of
Ancient Rome the authorities are many.&nbsp; In Jerusalem they
are few&mdash;but the Bible, Josephus and the Talmud.&nbsp; It is
only of late that we got at the real Jerusalem.&nbsp; It was not
till explorations, surveys, and excavations were made that
anything beyond tradition, mostly false, was known of the ancient
city.&nbsp; It is below its modern level that one has to trace
the remains of the real Jerusalem.&nbsp; As Byron wrote of Rome,
so we may say of the Holy City:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The Goth, the Christian,
time, war, flood, and fire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have dealt upon the seven-hilled city&rsquo;s
pride.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She saw her glories star by star expire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And up the steep barbarian monarchs ride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the car climbed the Capitol; far and wide,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Temple and tower went down, nor left a site:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Chaos of ruins! who shall trace the void,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er the dim fragments cast a lunar light,<br
/>
And say, &ldquo;Here was, or is,&rdquo; where all is doubly
night?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was not till 1868 that the time arrived for cheap
excursions to Jerusalem.&nbsp; The credit of the idea is to be
given to the late Mr. Thomas Cook.&nbsp; In the time of the
Crusades the bands which visited Palestine did so <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>under a
leader.&nbsp; At a later date parties travelled in the form of a
caravan.&nbsp; Before visiting the lands of the Bible Mr. Cook
consulted that eminent traveller and at one time popular author
and lecturer, Mr. James Silk Buckingham, as to the best
route,&mdash;and collected information from every available
quarter.&nbsp; Then he made the trip by himself in 1868.&nbsp; On
his return home he advertised a tour in Palestine and the Nile in
the following spring.&nbsp; Before a month had elapsed thirty-two
ladies and gentlemen had taken tickets for the trip to the Nile
and Palestine, and thirty to Palestine only; and now they come by
the hundred at a time, so popular is the trip.&nbsp; From the
year 1868 up to 1891, 1,200 persons had visited Palestine under
Cook&rsquo;s protection.&nbsp; Many of these travellers held high
social positions, such as their Royal Highnesses the Duke of
Edinburgh, the Duke of Clarence and Avondale, Prince George of
Wales; their Imperial Highnesses the Grand Duke and Duchess
Sergius, the Grand Duke Paul of Russia, the King of Servia, and
other travellers of distinction.&nbsp; It is a part of the
business of the firm much patronized by American tourists and the
clergy of all denominations.&nbsp; Up to the time of the firm
taking up the matter, travellers were at the mercy of savage
chiefs, who made them pay dearly for the permission which they
granted to pass through their districts.&nbsp; These chiefs were
as fickle as they were avaricious, and as dilatory as they were
exacting.&nbsp; All this vexatious delay has vanished.&nbsp; When
you start you are certain of arrival at the day indicated, and of
being able to return in a similar manner.&nbsp; Moreover, the
element of danger has been eliminated.&nbsp; You are safe in
Jerusalem as in London&mdash;perhaps safer; for as <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>there is
always danger in the streets of London from hardened criminals
and careless drivers of cabs and omnibuses, and the
ever-increasing multitude of men and women who have taken to the
bicycle&mdash;and &lsquo;rush in where angels fear to
tread.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Finally, after Omar and Saladin, Syria and Palestine were
conquered by Selim, and since then, with the slight advent of the
Crusaders, have formed part of the Turkish Empire.&nbsp; The
inhabitants complain a good deal of the injustice and corruption
of the Turkish tax-gatherers, and I fancy not without reason; but
that the city is prosperous and flourishing now is evident to the
most superficial observer, from the number of new buildings
erected in every direction.&nbsp; I believe it is a fact that the
number of people living outside the city is far greater than the
population within.&nbsp; It is a fashion to build schools and
churches and convents everywhere, Russia in this respect standing
ahead of the rest.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care to go into the
city.&nbsp; What I see there is all fiction, hallowed, if you
like, by the superstition of ages.&nbsp; In the daytime all is
noise and confusion.&nbsp; The trader sits in his little shop in
a narrow street, covered from the sun, and there the people
collect in every variety of costume&mdash;some in rags and almost
naked; others, like the cavass of some consulate, in a dark,
showy dress, with a grand sword hanging from his thigh; but the
prevailing fashion seems to be a brown or blue jacket hanging
over a print skirt extending down to the feet.&nbsp; Some are
almost as black as niggers.</p>
<p>Immense as is the traffic of the city and the noise and tumult
by day, the silence by night is equally wonderful.&nbsp; There is
no living soul or body to be seen in the streets by
night&mdash;nor a light; not even the bark <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>of a dog is
heard.&nbsp; There is scarce a street in which you can walk
comfortably either inside Jerusalem or outside.&nbsp; There are
stones everywhere to throw you down, and then there is the
dust.&nbsp; That deserves a chapter in itself.&nbsp; It is simply
awful.&nbsp; There is a cartload of it inside me now.&nbsp; It is
white as snow; it fills the air; you can see nothing.&nbsp; As we
got out of the railway-station, and got into carriages to drive
towards the hotel, we could not see an inch of the way on account
of the dust.&nbsp; To make it worse, the drivers all set out at
full speed, and in the race to get in first it seemed to me that
a collision was inevitable; however, happily, no casualty
occurred.&nbsp; A poor unfortunate donkey was run over&mdash;that
was all.</p>
<p>As an illustration of what the natives have to suffer under
Turkish rule, let me give the following account of a gossip with
a driver I met with.&nbsp; His father had died and left him a
little property in the fertile plain of Sharon.&nbsp; The man did
all he could to improve it&mdash;fenced it with stones, dug it
over and enriched the soil, planted olive-trees and dates, and
then, when the crop was nearly ready, the Turkish taxpayer came
and demanded a third of the estimated value, and got it.&nbsp; In
a fortnight after he was visited by the Bedouins, who took
another third, and in the end the poor man had to give up his
little farm.&nbsp; The Turks are bad, but the lawless Bedouins
who harry the land are infinitely worse.&nbsp; For instance, one
of our party drove down to Jericho by himself.&nbsp; He got out
to walk in one part of the road, and got ahead of his
driver.&nbsp; Immediately he found himself surrounded by a crew
of these ruffians.&nbsp; Happily, he had with him the American
Consul&rsquo;s cavass, who, seeing the position, came up with his
<a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>

</a><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>loaded
revolver, at the sight of which the gentleman was rescued, as the
rascals fled.&nbsp; There is no taming the Bedouin of the
desert.&nbsp; He only owns the rule of his sheikh.&nbsp; The
Turkish ruler of the province is afraid of him, and actually pays
him a tribute to be allowed to send his yearly offering to
Mecca.&nbsp; No wonder the land is bare of life.&nbsp; It is a
wonder that there is any cultivation at all.&nbsp; The people are
forced to live in villages, remote from one another, and there
they defend themselves against the enemy as best they can.&nbsp;
You see nowhere a farmhouse, a cottage, or country house.&nbsp;
For miles and miles not a human habitation is visible.</p>
<p>As most of us are sitting half asleep in the smoking-room
after our mid-day meal, a wailing sound reaches my ears.&nbsp; I
rush to the window and see a funeral procession.&nbsp; Someone
has died in one of the houses above us, and they are bearing the
dead body into the city for burial.&nbsp; About 100 men and women
follow, wailing as they go, while on each side of the
coffin&mdash;a very unsightly structure borne on a rude
bier&mdash;walk the black-robed priests, evidently of the Greek
Church.&nbsp; The sight is not particularly imposing as the
procession makes its way, while the world goes on selling and
buying much as usual.&nbsp; I pity the poor mourners and the
priests as they move slowly along.&nbsp; I know not, but perhaps
the presence of so many priests may indicate that the deceased
was a person of some consequence in his community.</p>
<p>I resume my writing, and then a native comes in to rub off the
white dust which has come in through the open window.&nbsp; It is
impossible to keep out the fine white dust, and all day the flies
are equally troublesome.&nbsp; <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>I hear of some of the ladies being
bitten by the mosquitoes, but the latter, happily, leave me
alone.&nbsp; The courteous manners of the dragomans who fill the
hall of the hotel are amusing.&nbsp; All of them seem much
interested as to my health, and anxiously inquire how I
slept.&nbsp; As I write, Mr. Howard&rsquo;s nephew is arranging
the papers in the smoking-room; a native enters, who kisses the
back of his hand with effusion&mdash;a 
<a href="images/p95b.jpg">

</a>pledge, I learn, of faithful service.&nbsp; As to the people
in general, they seem to be mere drudges and to have little idea
of amusement; amusement in the Holy City is not tolerated.&nbsp;
Now and then you see in the narrow, darkened streets a few
sitting round a hookah, enjoying a quiet smoke, but the people,
dressed out in all the colours of the rainbow, plod up and down
wearily in a never-ending stream, in pursuance of their daily <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>tasks.&nbsp;
A good deal of building is going on outside the city walls.&nbsp;
There is no scaffolding, no hodman with bricks and mortar; the
solid stone walls seem to grow up in the most hopeless
confusion.&nbsp; Of course you see no decent carriages.&nbsp;
Around the door of the hotel there is a daily collection of
donkeys and horses and carriages, the last all white with dust
and of the most rickety character.&nbsp; One would think they
would fall to pieces over the bad roads, almost as bad as those
of Constantinople; but I hear of no accident, though it seems as
you watch the flying crowd that one may occur at any moment.</p>
<p>As I chat with my dragoman, I ask him if he is married.&nbsp;
His reply is that he cannot afford it; it would cost him
&pound;60 to get a wife.&nbsp; Perhaps it were as well that the
cost of a wife in England were as much; we might have fewer
marriages of the kind that tend to misery and want.&nbsp; The
servants in the hotel seemed remarkably honest.&nbsp; There was a
lock to my door, but I could not get it to act, so my room
remained unlocked, and I missed nothing, even when one morning I
left my purse on the table, containing all my money, when I went
to breakfast.&nbsp; A breakfast consists of hot rolls, good
coffee, and delicious honey.&nbsp; At lunch the first course
consists of olives, radishes, lemons and vegetables, which are
supposed to create an appetite.&nbsp; At dinner we have a
wonderful lot of stewed flesh, and vegetables are often served up
as a separate course.&nbsp; In the evening the hall is lighted up
with many lamps, and the dealers come and turn it into a
bazaar.&nbsp; They are not above making a considerable
reduction.&nbsp; But really there is very little manufactured in
Jerusalem&mdash;the Sacred City.&nbsp; Oh, how I loathe the term
as I <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>tread
the church of the reputed Holy Sepulchre&mdash;its stones
slippery with the tread of millions of pilgrims in all ages, its
sacred shrines worn away by the kisses of the faithful.&nbsp; As
I sit outside, a cripple comes to a pillar of the door, on which
a cross has been rudely carved.&nbsp; He kisses that cross and
stands there praying.&nbsp; Those poor devotees&mdash;how they
kiss, and kneel, and crawl, and pray!</p>
<p>The most interesting man I have seen is the Rev. Ben
Oliel.&nbsp; Born in Morocco in 1826, a man wonderfully active
for his years, you would not take him to be more than sixty at
the best.&nbsp; At Tangiers he attended the Rabbinical schools,
learning Spanish at home, Arabic out of doors, and Hebrew and
Chaldee at school.&nbsp; He speaks English with great readiness
and fluency.&nbsp; When eighteen years of age he read the New
Testament for the first time, but his father took it away from
him&mdash;however, not before a spirit of inquiry was raised in
his mind.&nbsp; In 1847, while visiting at Gibraltar, he became
acquainted with a Christian friend, who gave him the
&lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&rsquo; and &lsquo;Keith on
Prophecy&rsquo; to read.&nbsp; From them he learnt that Jesus was
the Messiah and the Saviour of men.&nbsp; He then resolved to
come to England to prepare to preach the Gospel to the
Jews.&nbsp; The committee of the Society for the Promotion of
Christianity among the Jews accepted his services, and sent him
to labour in Gibraltar and North Africa.&nbsp; During a visit to
England in 1850 he translated the Gospel of St. Luke into
Hebrew-Spanish, and also a number of tracts into Hebrew and
Spanish.&nbsp; In 1852 he was ordained to the ministry in Orange
Street Chapel, London, by twelve ministers representing
Presbyterian, Congregational, <a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>Baptist, and Lutheran Churches.&nbsp;
Shortly after he was recognised by the Presbytery of Edinburgh as
a minister, and ordained a missionary of that church, and was
sent to Thessalonica and Smyrna, where he established
missions.&nbsp; Later on his old society&mdash;the
British&mdash;sent him to Algiers, when he succeeded in inducing
his relatives to become Christians, who are now usefully employed
in Christian work.&nbsp; Mr. Ben Oliel has been twice
married&mdash;first to a daughter of Rev. B. Lewis, a Baptist
minister of London, and then, after a widowerhood of some years,
to a sister of Mr. Seeley, Vicar of Clacton-on-Sea, and a cousin
of Professor Seeley, author of &lsquo;Ecce Homo.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We next find him in Spain.&nbsp; In Cadiz he laboured with
much success, sometimes having a congregation of 1,000
hearers.&nbsp; He opened schools for both sexes, where he had as
many as 360 children.&nbsp; His success provoked the animosity
and opposition of the Romish priests, who started a newspaper to
put him down.&nbsp; Thence, for reasons perfectly satisfactory,
he returned to his old scene of labour in Algeria, and commenced
a very successful mission at Oran.&nbsp; From Oran he was sent to
Rome to labour among the Jews, and then the question was put to
him&mdash;would he go to Jerusalem?&nbsp; To this question there
could be only one, and that an affirmative, reply.&nbsp; In the
ancient city he is certainly the right man in the right
place.&nbsp; In the first place, he can converse in Hebrew with
learned Jews and Rabbis, with whom the city is full.&nbsp; It is
a curious fact that Hebrew is fast becoming a living tongue in
Jerusalem, as is evident from the fact that the only newspapers
now published in Palestine are two weeklies in Jerusalem, both in
the Hebrew tongue.&nbsp; Another <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>advantage Mr. Ben Oliel possesses is
that he can talk to the Sephardim Spanish Jews in their own
dialect; and they, it seems, are the most ancient in the city and
the most easy of access; and then, again, as an
undenominationalist, he has provided an upper room, where he
holds an English service on a Sunday, sometimes attended by as
many as 100 English-speaking travellers from all parts of the
world.&nbsp; His work is now entirely supported by friends,
especially Americans, who sympathize in his aim.&nbsp; He has no
great society at his back; he fights on his own behalf, in faith
that the supplies when needed will come.&nbsp; In his work he is
greatly aided by his devoted wife and daughter, who have
established schools&mdash;one of them a sewing-class of girls, to
which I paid a visit.</p>
<p>In his schools Mr. Oliel met with great opposition from the
Jewish Rabbis.&nbsp; They held a conference on the subject.&nbsp;
The outcome of their conference was seen the following
Saturday.&nbsp; Great and solemn warning was preached in every
synagogue at morning prayer to the Jews not to continue going to
the Christians, and earnest pleading with them to put an end to
this sin in Israel.&nbsp; On the doors of all synagogues, inside
and outside town, were placards, some of which were handed to
individuals.&nbsp; Here is a translation of one:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Inasmuch as we hear that two schools of the
English have been opened, one inside and the other outside the
town, and women, sons and daughters of the Israelite people are
going to them, and according to the information that reaches us
they are stumbling in the sin of idolatry, for above all they are
required to <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>believe in their religion, as their conditions, as it
is heard; we heard and our bowels trembled, how can it be that
because of straits we should forsake our faith, God forbid, and
believe in the sin of idolatry, and the end will be that in a
short time they will abandon the Holy Law and turn to the law of
the Protestants, God forbid, whose whole interest is to tempt and
push precious souls of Israel and bring them to their faith,
thereupon they are told in the name of the <i>First in Zion</i>,
and in the name of the exalted Rabbis, even <i>all the fathers of
the House of Judges</i>, <i>the righteous</i>, and in the name of
all the Rabbis, that from this day forward, after we have given
them to understand the heavy forbidden thing they are
doing&mdash;certain that Israel are holy&mdash;they should
withdraw and not go to those places, neither women nor young men,
nor girls or little children at all, and let them trust in the
Blessed be His Name, who feeds and nourishes all, and to whom is
the power and the greatness, and let them not think for a moment
of benefit, whose end is bitter like poison of losing their
Judaism, God forbid; and no benefit will they derive from those
cents, and keep this exhortation before their eyes continually
all the days; and in eight days from to-day those schools will be
found empty, that no Jew&rsquo;s foot shall tread in them any
more, which we shall hear and rejoice, and if, which God forbid,
that time arriving and any still continue to go, let them know
assuredly that as they sought to separate themselves from the
community of the people of Israel, we also therefore will
endeavour with all our strength to separate from them.&nbsp; If
sons are born to them, there will be no one to circumcise them,
if any get married, there will be no one to give the nuptial
blessings.&nbsp; If <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>any die, they will not be buried
with the Jews.&nbsp; The women will not be married to Jews.&nbsp;
To young men no Jewesses will be given.&nbsp; They will be a
separate people.&nbsp; We trust that from this day forward they
will withdraw from the said schools, and despise them as unclean,
and will not go near their doors; and will have trust in God,
exalted be His Name, preferring to starve to death as Jews, and
not arrive to this measure [of punishment].&nbsp; And let them
not suppose that we shall be silent, but we shall persecute them
to the bitter end as far as our hands can reach.</p>

<p>Considering that the Rabbis have considerable sums of money
sent them from abroad to distribute among the poor every month,
and that many houses are given to the worthy penniless free of
rent for several years, it is no wonder that the parents of the
little ones were afraid to disobey their tyrannic rulers, and
kept their children away from the school.</p>
<p>I find the Y.M.C.A. have a branch here, founded by Mr. Hind
Smith in 1890, and are doing useful work, and just outside the
Jaffa Gate is a depot for the sale of Bibles.&nbsp; But I have
been somewhat astonished at the bitter, exclusive spirit
displayed in some quarters where I might have hoped for better
things.&nbsp; It is difficult for a Jew to make a profession of
Christianity.&nbsp; If he does so, he has to leave the place at
once.&nbsp; The strong caste spirit among the Jews is also very
great.&nbsp; The high caste will not associate with the men of a
lower caste.&nbsp; But where people dare not go to the <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>recognised
agencies for Jewish conversion, many come to Mr. Oliel for a
chat, and Turks as well.&nbsp; Such missionary work as he does
seems to be of the right stamp and worthy of British
support.&nbsp; An increasing interest is being taken in
Jerusalem, though, alas! I cannot say with the Psalmist,
&lsquo;Thy servants take pleasure in her stones and favour the
dust thereof.&rsquo;&nbsp; They are my stumbling-block by night
and day.</p>

103</span>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">BETHLEHEM.</p>
<p>The one spot in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem which one must
visit is Bethlehem, the birthplace of the Christ, the music of
whose voice and the lustre of whose life have brightened and
bettered all the ages, dark and dreary as many of them have been,
ever since.&nbsp; It is difficult to visit such a place alone; it
is impossible to visit it in company with a garrulous and
credulous crowd.&nbsp; I had for companions an esteemed clergyman
from Leeds and an Oxford scholar, a man of infinite learning and
wit.&nbsp; There had been rain overnight, and the dust was not so
much of a nuisance as it generally is, and, besides, we had a
refreshing breeze.&nbsp; We did the whole trip between breakfast
and lunch.&nbsp; Starting in one of the shabby-looking
carriages&mdash;the only available vehicle in these parts, which
one expects to break down every minute&mdash;drawn by a couple of
half-starved steeds, it rattled along over the stones at a speed
for which one was scarcely prepared.&nbsp; On my way I learned a
fact that I may not have mentioned before&mdash;viz., that at
Constantinople the Sultan had given special orders for the
comfort of the excursionists arriving in the <i>Midnight Sun</i>
by placing a guard of soldiers around <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>the ship to keep off the crowd, and
by giving special orders that the party were to be everywhere
received with courtesy and respect.&nbsp; As regards myself,
seeing that not very long since the Sultan had ordered one of my
books to be burnt, I must own that I felt his conduct in this
matter to redound very much to his credit.</p>
<p>We leave our hotel by the road running to the right from
outside the Jaffa Gate, and admire very much the long range of
neat almshouses built for the poor Jews by the late Sir Moses
Montefiore, leaving the Hill of Evil Counsel to the left, and the
pretty, red-roofed, clean-looking village inhabited by the German
Templars&rsquo; community to the right.&nbsp; Then the road
passes by the Valley of Rephaim on the right, where David fought
twice with the Philistines and conquered them, the signal for the
battle the second time being given by a &lsquo;going in the tops
of the mulberry-trees,&rsquo; which betokened the presence of the
Lord.&nbsp; A round stone on the left denotes the well in which,
when quenching their thirst, the Wise Men from the East beheld
once more reflected in its waters, to their &lsquo;exceeding
great joy,&rsquo; the star which led them in search of the
new-born King of the Jews.&nbsp; On our left is the convent of
Mar Elias, now occupied by a brotherhood belonging to the Greek
Church.&nbsp; Far off on our right is Giloh, white and glittering
in the sun, where dwelt Ahithophel, the Gilonite, David&rsquo;s
counsellor.&nbsp; It is now a village inhabited exclusively by
Christians.</p>
<p>Again, on our right, we come to Rachel&rsquo;s Tomb, at a
point where the great highroad to Hebron is left for the road to
Bethlehem.&nbsp; There is no dispute as to the identity of
Rachel&rsquo;s tomb; at any rate, for ages the <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>same legend
has been connected with the spot.&nbsp; For hundreds of years the
site was marked by a pyramid of twelve stones, placed there for
the twelve tribes of Israel.&nbsp; The present monument, built by
the Moslems, is white&mdash;as every building is in this part of
the world&mdash;an oblong erection, with a small dome on the
top.&nbsp; One of my learned friends points to the whiteness of 
<a href="images/p105b.jpg">
<img class='floatright' alt=
"Bethlehem.  (From a Photograph by Fradelle and Young)"
title=
"Bethlehem.  (From a Photograph by Fradelle and Young)"
src="images/p105s.jpg" />
</a>the limestone which lines all the roads, and which is
utilized in all the buildings, whether private or public, as an
illustration of the falsehood of the legend connected with the
home of Our Lady of Loretto, which, according to monkish legend,
flew all the way from Palestine to Italy, where yet it
remains.&nbsp; The stone of that building is red, a significant
proof of the falsehood of the tale.&nbsp; The next point of
interest is David&rsquo;s Well, <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>in commemoration of the incident
recorded in Samuel, when the Philistines being in possession of
the town, and David in a hold in or near Cave Adullam, he said:
&lsquo;Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well
of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!&nbsp; And the three mighty
men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out
of the well of Bethlehem, which was by the gate, and took it and
brought it to David; nevertheless, he would not drink thereof,
but poured it out unto the Lord.&nbsp; And he said . . .&nbsp; Is
not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their
lives?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And now I am in Bethlehem&mdash;not a simple country village,
as many imagine, but a densely-populated town, with winding,
narrow ways, where men and women and children, camels, donkeys,
and carriages, seem mixed up in wild disorder.&nbsp; On every
side we are shut in with habitations&mdash;stony, bare of
windows, built high up, with here and there a shop, but chiefly
with a simple door on the ground-floor; and then we dash into the
market-place, and apparently it is market-day, and half of the
open space is filled with buyers and sellers in many-coloured
garments of the East; and down on us come the guides and small
pedlars, shrieking, ejaculating, spluttering in broken English,
just as Byron tells us the Assyrian came down like the wolf on
the fold.</p>
<p>We enter the Church of the Nativity, regarded as the very
oldest specimen of Christian architecture; and a very ugly
building it is.&nbsp; In one of the remote quarters I came to an
old stone font, bearing the inscription: &lsquo;For the memory,
repose and forgiveness of sinners, of whom the Lord knows the
name.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here, <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>in 1161, Baldwin was crowned King of
Jerusalem.&nbsp; Look up at the roof as you pass along, of pure
wood and lead, furnished in 1482 by Edward IV. of England and
Philip of Burgundy.&nbsp; The guardianship of the church is
divided among Greeks, Armenians, and Latins.&nbsp; We are
supplied with tapers, and go down in the cave where the Christ
was born.&nbsp; A little further on is the place of the manger in
which He was laid.&nbsp; In another section of the cave, all hewn
out of the solid rock, Joseph is said to have slept when he was
warned by God in a dream to take Mary and her child and fly into
Egypt.&nbsp; Again, we are shown the spot where the children
massacred by King Herod were interred.&nbsp; Fifteen lamps
perpetually illuminate the subterranean Church of the Nativity,
near which is the Altar of the Adoration, which commemorates the
visit of the Magi.&nbsp; Amidst darkness visible we make our way
to the cave in which St. Jerome wrote his great work, the
translation of the Hebrew Bible into the Vulgate or Latin
tongue.&nbsp; It is a dark and dreary spot, and near by we are
shown his tomb.&nbsp; One can scarce credit the story of his
having done such work in such a corner, or believe that there he
lived to reach the ripe age of ninety-two.&nbsp; A year in such a
spot would be enough to kill an ordinary orthodox Christian in
these degenerate days.&nbsp; I make my exit speedily into the
upper air.&nbsp; I have seen enough for one day; no lying legend
can tempt me further.&nbsp; The enormous pile of churches built
up over the sacred sites, and inhabited by priests of rival
Churches, who hate each other like poison, are too much for
me.</p>
<p>Bethlehem is the market-place of the Dead Sea Bedouins, and
also of the numerous small towns and <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>villages in the vicinity, and has
besides some nourishing manufactures of its own.&nbsp; Its
inhabitants are almost exclusively Christian.&nbsp; The people
are chiefly employed in the production of embroidered dresses,
and in carving in a beautiful way mother-of-pearl.&nbsp; I hear
that they are an intelligent and industrious people, and that
there are plenty of schools for the children.&nbsp; The women are
said to be fair, but I see none such.&nbsp; On our way back we
are shown the Field of the Shepherds, sloping up a neighbouring
hill.&nbsp; It was there the angel of the Lord appeared to them
as they watched their sheep by night.&nbsp; We pass by also the
Pools of Solomon&mdash;three reservoirs made by the great King
for supplying the inhabitants of Jerusalem with water.&nbsp; All
the country round is a scene of great activity, as is evident
from the enormous amount of terraces to be seen everywhere
planted with the universal olive-tree.&nbsp; But at this time we
see nothing but stones, with here and there a few black goats
climbing the mountain-sides; all life seems to have withered up
under the scorching sun.&nbsp; The Wells of Solomon contain no
water, the hills no sign of vegetation.&nbsp; They are dry, and
so are we.</p>
<p>On the whole, after my visit to Bethlehem, I quite agree with
an American writer&mdash;the Rev. Mr. Tompkins&mdash;in his
remarks on the church built by the Empress Helena.&nbsp; While
vast, imposing, and suggestive of past glory, it is a fitting
monument of that kind of Christianity which, let us hope, is
relegated to the past.&nbsp; No instance of an enormous expensive
building could show more clearly the folly of erecting to God
that which has no earthly use.&nbsp; Unless men can see in future
ages that Christianity is for man, and not for <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>God, I
fancy that religion will perish from the earth.&nbsp; To-day one
stands in this edifice, which in point of size is justly
comparable with any church in the world, and wonders what rash
folly ever possessed the Empress to waste so much money.&nbsp; It
is so dreary, so cold, so deserted, so utterly the shell of
Christianity, that Christianity seems a very farce right here
where it began.</p>

110</span>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">THE JEW IN JERUSALEM.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting evenings I spent in Jerusalem was
in listening to a lecture by Dr. Wheeler, of the English Hospital
in the city, who is now seeking to build a hospital for the Jews
there.&nbsp; He is also, I believe, connected with the London
Society which is seeking to bring over the Jew to the knowledge
of the Messiah, a task by no means easy, as the conviction of the
Jew&mdash;that the promised Messiah is yet to come&mdash;is not
easily to be dispelled.&nbsp; I came over with a converted
Jew&mdash;a clergyman in London.&nbsp; His parents, who were
wealthy, lived in Jerusalem.&nbsp; In order to become a Christian
he had to sacrifice all his worldly prospects, and aroused such
bitter enmity on the part of his relatives that, though he had
made the journey for the sake of seeing his dying mother, he
almost despaired of an interview, and had to wait five days
before his object was achieved.</p>
<p>But to return to Dr. Wheeler.&nbsp; He has been at work in
Jerusalem eleven years, and his knowledge of the state of the
Jews is profound.&nbsp; The Jews, he told us, in Palestine may be
roughly divided into four classes: The Ashkenazim, comprising the
fair-haired, sallow <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>German Jew, the Russian, Polish,
American, etc., who speak Yiddish, and enjoy the protection of
the consuls of the countries to which they belong; the Sephardim,
or Spanish Jews, many of whom still wear the black turban imposed
on them by the mad Caliph Halim; the Gemenites, who have only
recently come to the land&mdash;they are dark, and wear their
hair in side-curls; and the Karaites, a sect which sprang up
about the eighth century.&nbsp; These reject the Talmud and deny
the authority of the Oral Law; they are few in number, and have
but one small synagogue; the orthodox religious Jews have no
religious intercourse with them, and regard them as
heretics.&nbsp; The Ashkenazim adapt themselves to any
costume.&nbsp; The Sephardim all wear the dignified and beautiful
Oriental costume.&nbsp; All unite in wearing the
love-locks.&nbsp; As to the women, they all dress in Oriental
costume, and wear their heads covered.&nbsp; On the Sabbath they
are all dressed in their best.&nbsp; Charms are worn on the heads
and foreheads and necks of young children, and a sprig of green
is worn also as a charm against the evil eye.&nbsp; The Rabbis
generally wear long flowing robes, trimmed with fur, and also a
turban.</p>
<p>Specially-appointed Rabbis see that the food is properly
prepared, as everything must be <i>kosha</i>, or legally
clean.&nbsp; Milk must not be taken before or after meat.&nbsp;
No Christian food on any account may be consumed; even eggs
cooked in Christian pots are refused.&nbsp; Only Jewish wine may
be drunk, and if a bottle of it is only touched by a Christian it
becomes unclean.&nbsp; The social and religious life of the Jew
is identical.&nbsp; The birth of a son causes great rejoicing,
and improves <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>the social status of the mother.&nbsp; Circumcision on
the eighth day, if the child is strong enough, is a holy
festival.&nbsp; After eighteen all Jews are expected to
marry.&nbsp; Although facilities of divorce are large, they are
not often resorted to.</p>
<p>One is struck, said Dr. Wheeler, in living among Jews, with
the fact that religion amongst them is not only a creed or an act
of observance, but that it pervades every relationship and
dominates every phase of life.&nbsp; The Sabbath is the pivot
round which family life moves.&nbsp; It is a day of real
rejoicing, accompanied by a complete suspension of work.&nbsp; It
begins with the cup of blessing, of wine mixed with water, of
which all partake.&nbsp; The Sabbath lamp is lit.&nbsp; No burial
is allowed on that day.&nbsp; No phylacteries are worn while the
Cohenites give the Aaronic blessing&mdash;&lsquo;The Lord bless
thee and keep thee,&rsquo; etc.&nbsp; Visiting the sick has great
merit.&nbsp; According to the Talmud, eleven visits to the sick
will release a soul from Gehenna.&nbsp; All are enjoined to
follow funerals, and to pay honour to the remains of the
dead.&nbsp; After death the body is allowed to remain awhile
unburied.&nbsp; The creed of the Jew is as ancient as the
beginning of history.&nbsp; With it are connected the triumphs
and struggles and defeats of ages.&nbsp; What strange and
opposite feelings has the name of Jew created!&nbsp; What
appalling deeds have been perpetrated in connection with his
name!&nbsp; The Jew is in every sense, as Dr. Wheeler eloquently
told us, the marvel of history&mdash;the wonder of the
ages&mdash;the anomaly of nations.&nbsp; So it has been for
upwards of 4,000 years.&nbsp; He is Heaven&rsquo;s great witness
on earth of earth&rsquo;s righteous King in heaven.&nbsp; Nations
have risen and fallen.&nbsp; Mighty empires have crumbled <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>to
decay.&nbsp; Assyria, Greece, Carthage, where are they?&nbsp; Yet
the Jew&mdash;scattered, despised, persecuted, and trampled under
foot&mdash;has never disappeared.&nbsp; Nay, more, he has risen
to be a light and guide to the nations; and many are the
statesmen and artists and philosophers who have had Jewish blood
in their veins.&nbsp; And yet, say certain good people, the Jews
are under a curse.&nbsp; Well, perhaps they are&mdash;when
poor.&nbsp; Poor people, it seems to me, are under a curse all
the world over.&nbsp; To the Jews, Jerusalem is the one holy
city, and here they come to die and be buried in its sacred
soil.&nbsp; Wealthy Jews in all parts of the world give freely
for charity and for charitable purposes, and it is this wealth
that brings so many poor Jews to Jerusalem.&nbsp; By these
benefactors Jewish children are educated gratuitously.&nbsp; They
have three synagogues, all very ancient, and the beautiful
pale-green dome of one of them is a conspicuous feature in the
view of Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives.&nbsp; Jews, because
they persecuted the Christ, are not allowed to pass before the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre.&nbsp; They are also still
rigorously excluded from the Moslem sanctuary, where it is said
stood King Solomon&rsquo;s Temple in all its glory, though
Christians have been admitted of late years to this
jealously-guarded spot, containing as it does the Dome of the
Rock&mdash;a very precious spot in Moslem eyes.&nbsp; Alas!
everywhere the Jew in Jerusalem has to come in contact with
&lsquo;the pig of a Turk,&rsquo; as he contemptuously calls
him.&nbsp; I wonder the wealthy Jews do not buy Jerusalem or
Palestine itself of the Sultan, who, however, does all he can to
keep the Jews from returning there to live and die.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the place it fills in the world&rsquo;s history,
the <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>country is a small one.&nbsp; As it is, the Jews in
Jerusalem have the greater part of the trade of the city in their
hands.&nbsp; They own the shops and the cabs, and their numbers
increase every day, very much, as I have said, against the wishes
of the Sultan himself.</p>
<p>It is an awful history, that of the Jew in Jerusalem, of
incessant revolt on the part of the people, of incessant conquest
and massacre on the part of the sanguinary conquerors.&nbsp;
Again and again the Jew seemed on the brink of
extermination.&nbsp; Nebuchadnezzar, Antiochus, Titus, Hadrian,
successively exerted their utmost power to extinguish, not merely
the political existence of the State, but even the separate being
of the people.&nbsp; Hadrian, to annihilate for ever, writes Dean
Milman, all hopes of the restoration of the Jewish kingdom,
accomplished his plan of founding a new city on the site of
Jerusalem, peopled by a colony of foreigners.&nbsp; The city was
called &AElig;lia Capitolina: &AElig;lia after the pr&aelig;nomen
of the Emperor, Capitolina as dedicated to the Jupiter of the
Capitol.&nbsp; An edict was published to prevent any Jew from
entering the new city under pain of death, or approaching its
environs even at a distance so as to contemplate its sacred
height.&nbsp; More effectually to keep them away, the image of a
swine was placed over the gate leading to Bethlehem.&nbsp; The
more peaceful Christians were permitted to establish themselves
within the walls, and &AElig;lia became the seat of a flourishing
church and bishopric.&nbsp; At a later period Julian the
Apostate&mdash;as the ecclesiastical writers term one of the
noblest men who ever wore the imperial purple&mdash;embraced the
extraordinary design of rebuilding the Temple of Jerusalem.&nbsp;
In a public epistle to the nation or community <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>of the
Jews, he pities their misfortunes, condemns their oppressors,
praises their constancy, declares himself their gracious
protector, and hopes, after his return from the Persian war, he
may be permitted to pay his grateful vows to the Almighty in the
holy city of Jerusalem.&nbsp; The Jews from every part of the
world gave freely to assist this pious enterprise.&nbsp;
According to the Christian writers, Heaven interfered, and the
Temple was left unbuilt.&nbsp; This glorious deliverance was
speedily improved by the pious art of the clergy of Jerusalem and
the active credulity of the Christian world.&nbsp; It is evident,
as Gibbon remarks, the restoration of the Jewish Temple was
secretly connected with the ruin of the Christian Church, a
Church for which Julian had little love.&nbsp; From the
confessions of Jerome himself, Jerusalem seemed saturated with
every form of vice and crime.</p>
<p>They tell me the Jew is blind because he is waiting for the
coming Messiah, but, I ask, are we not all waiting for a coming
Messiah?&nbsp; And the sooner He comes the better for all of us,
Jew and Gentile alike.&nbsp; If the Jew is waiting for a coming
Messiah, that is surely to his credit&mdash;that he remains true
to the teaching of his fathers&mdash;and shows him to be no more
blind than those of us who piously await the dawn of a
millennium, which, according to all human appearances, seems as
far off as ever.&nbsp; When the Turkish Empire breaks up, it will
be no easy matter how to settle in whose hands Jerusalem shall be
placed.&nbsp; There may be a terrible fight about the Holy City
yet.</p>
<p>It is now the fashion for everyone to rush to Jerusalem.&nbsp;
At one time to go there required no little expenditure of money,
and time, and trouble.&nbsp; An <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>excursion-steamer takes you there
for a trifle compared with the expense of the journey only a few
years ago.&nbsp; You land at Jaffa, take the train to Jerusalem,
and in due time find yourself outside the Jaffa Gate, guarded by
Turkish soldiers.&nbsp; Amidst a dirty, many-coloured mob of
donkeys, camels, and people, exhausted by the heat, suffocated by
the dust, and bewildered by the noise, you are at the Holy City,
as lying superstition terms it.&nbsp; It certainly is not
Jerusalem the golden, but is very much the reverse.&nbsp; Its
smells are indescribable, and to drink its water is death.&nbsp;
Your first wonder is why David and Solomon should ever have made
it a royal residence at all.&nbsp; It is a city set upon a hill,
but it is dominated by hills all round, where no verdure is seen,
and where the black goat alone finds a scanty existence.&nbsp;
Climb one of these hills, and you look down on the gray, stony
city, surrounded by a high wall, over which rise minarets, and
mosques, and church spires in wild confusion.&nbsp; There is
nothing to charm the eye there.&nbsp; Enter through one of the
gates, and you are still more disappointed.&nbsp; You wander in
hopeless confusion, shut in on all sides by lofty buildings, with
no windows to speak of, only here and there a door; or you plunge
into a street with a dark awning, which serves as a bazaar, with
shops of all kinds around, where so dense is the crowd that it is
with difficulty you make your way.&nbsp; Poverty seems to be the
prevailing characteristic of the place.&nbsp; Even the shops fail
to attract.</p>
<p>Money is the one thing Jerusalem sucks in as a thirsty soul
does water when it comes, and many well-meaning people find there
a living prepared for them who would otherwise have to
starve.&nbsp; As to the real <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>state of the people you never hear a
word.&nbsp; The Turkish tax-gatherer may grind them down.&nbsp;
The wild Bedouin of the desert may come and take what the
tax-gatherer has left.&nbsp; But you hear nothing of that, and
the daily topic of conversation among the European settlers is
the repetition of dogma and the fulfilment of prophecy.&nbsp; It
is not till you have cleared out, taken the rail to Jaffa, and
sail along the blue waters of the Mediterranean, that you get rid
of the nightmare, have done with cant, and once more breathe
free.</p>
<p>The fact is, the Holy City is one gigantic fraud.&nbsp; All we
know is that there Christ lived and laboured and suffered and
died.&nbsp; Not a stone remains of the Jerusalem over whose
impending fate He shed bitter tears.&nbsp; The cunning of an
interested priesthood has done all the rest, from the discovery
of the true cross by the mother of Constantine, to the holy fire
which is seen at Easter by a panting, perspiring crowd in the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre.&nbsp; The town itself covers an
area of more than 209 acres, of which thirty-five are occupied by
the Haram-esh-Sherif.&nbsp; The remaining space is occupied by
Christians, Mohammedans, and Jews.</p>
<p>The Greek Church is the strongest branch of the Christians in
Jerusalem, having eighteen monasteries, with schools, churches, a
hospital, hospice, and a printing press.&nbsp; The Russian church
on the Mount of Olives is the grandest ecclesiastical building in
the city of the modern type.&nbsp; The Roman Catholics have fine
churches, monasteries, and convents.&nbsp; The Armenian Patriarch
resides in his convent between the Jaffa and Zion gates.&nbsp;
The Latins, Abyssinians, and Copts are also well
represented.&nbsp; The Knights Templars of the <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>Holy
Sepulchre, a Roman Catholic body under the patronage of the
Emperor of Austria, have a fine convent just outside the
walls.&nbsp; Priests, and nuns, and sisters of mercy, and
devotees, meet you at every turn.</p>
<p>One ought to go to Jerusalem if only to see what priests can
build up on small foundations, and to what length superstition
can be carried, even in what are termed days of light and
progress.&nbsp; In this respect the Turk is as great a sinner as
the Christian, and tells you how at the resurrection the risen
will have to cross the Valley of Jehosaphat by a bridge of the
Prophet&rsquo;s hair, from which the wicked will fall straight to
Gehenna, while to the righteous heaven, with its houris, will
open its diamond gates.&nbsp; You see in Jerusalem what you see
nowhere else, a city built up by religion, true or false.</p>
<p>In a letter from the Rev. Ben Oliel to a friend, he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;You want to know what is (1) the actual
population of Jerusalem; (2) the Jewish population in it; and (3)
the number of Jews in all Palestine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Turkish Government, like that of other lands, has
its statistical &ldquo;bureau&rdquo;&mdash;office; but whatever
may be its success in the European provinces of the empire, here
in Asia its computations are believed to be imperfect,
unreliable, and mainly guesswork.&nbsp; The conscription and
consequent tax for exemption from military service operate
against it.&nbsp; The heads of the several religious
communities&mdash;Turkish or Moslem, Jewish, Latin, Greek,
Armenian, Copt, Maronite, Melchite, etc.&mdash;who co-operate in
the census, have powerful motives to frustrate exactitude, for it
means a larger annual taxation, for which they are made <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>responsible; and, apart from this, the inhabitants have
strong prejudices against being numbered.&nbsp; Therefore, all
estimates of population are merely approximate, and nothing
more.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A young Jew of the highest family in this city, who is
employed in offices of trust in the Pasha&rsquo;s court and has
access to official records, a convert of this mission, who
confessed his faith in the Lord Jesus on October 27, tells me
that in official circles the population of Jerusalem, including
its suburbs&mdash;Bethlehem, Bethany, the Mount of Olives,
etc.&mdash;is now computed at 100,000, of which 60,000 are
believed to be Jews; and he declares my estimate of the general
population of Jerusalem and its immediate suburbs at from 65,000
to 70,000, and the Jewish at about 40,000, to be far too
low.&nbsp; He is custodian of the roll of the Sephardim
poor&mdash;widows, orphans, blind and decrepit old men and their
families&mdash;amounting to 7,000 souls, that have to be provided
for regularly; and yet the Ashkenazim constitute the majority of
the Jewish inhabitants of Jerusalem now, and they have a roll of
poor as large proportionately.&nbsp; He says the Sephardim pay
&pound;1,000 annually for exemption from military service, and
the Ashkenazim &pound;1,250, which, at the rate of two
<i>medjidis</i> per head, represents 5,625 men of the age liable
to service.&nbsp; Jewish families are prolific, and must
therefore be calculated at seven rather than five per family, and
if one in each family is liable to service, the result is 39,375
souls.&nbsp; But this has reference to the Jewish
<i>rayahs</i>&mdash;Turkish subjects; whereas there is a large
admixture of those under Russian, Austrian, German, etc.,
protection, who are free from taxation, military or other.&nbsp;
By such a <a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>process of reasoning his estimate of 60,000 Jews for
Jerusalem is almost proved mathematically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have before me Luncz&rsquo;s First Hebrew Almanack
for the Jewish year 1895&ndash;96, an interesting compilation; it
gives the population of Jerusalem thus: &ldquo;Number of
inhabitants 45,420, of which Jews 28,112 (viz., Ashkenazim
15,074, Sephardim 7,900, Mughrabim 2,420, Gurgis 670, Bucharis
530, Tamanites 1,288, Persians 230); Moslems 8,560; Christians
8,748 (viz., Armenians 695, Greeks 4,625, Abyssinians 105,
Syrians 23, Protestants 645, Catholics or Latins 2,530, Copts
125).&rdquo;&nbsp; He does not say so, but he can only mean the
population <i>inside the walls</i>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an illustration of the difficulties awaiting the Jew who is
led to renounce Judaism, I quote from a convert&rsquo;s letter a
few particulars:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I will briefly say that I commenced the
journey of life in Jerusalem as son of one of the first Jewish
families that found their way back to the fatherland.&nbsp;
According to the custom of our people, my dear mother sent me to
school when I was only two.&nbsp; I sat at the feet of our Rabbi
school-teachers until I was twelve; then I studied the
Rabbis&rsquo; commentaries and had an Arab tutor.&nbsp; At
thirteen years of age I entered the Seraya, or Government House
of Jerusalem.&nbsp; I studied to be an Arabic and Turkish scribe,
and attended the Jewish school to learn French.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the Government House there are three judges
appointed to represent respectively the Christian, Jewish, and
Moslem citizens.&nbsp; My uncle is the Jewish judge.&nbsp; At
sixteen I became one of the scribes of the Chief Justice, and two
years ago his assistant secretary.</p>
<p><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>&lsquo;When I used to visit Jaffa I heard about Mr. Ben
Oliel from many Jews who frequented his house for discussion and
study of God&rsquo;s Word.&nbsp; In 1890 he came up to Jerusalem,
and at last I met him.&nbsp; The first time that I called upon
him I was in company with my father, my uncle the judge, the son
of the Chief Rabbi, and another Rabbi, one of the judges of the
Jewish Court.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Chief Rabbi appoints twelve judges, who each serve
a term of three months every year, and every dispute between Jews
must first be brought before them, and, if needs be, is referred
by them to the Turkish Court.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In time the writer became a Christian and was baptized.&nbsp;
He adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;It was my desire to get the training that
would make me a good Christian teacher, but I could not travel
without a passport, and could not get this except through the
application of my father, who, instead, gave strict orders that
no passport should be made for me.&nbsp; After a year of vain
endeavour, I was able to persuade a friend who was in the office
where they are written, on the score of friendship, to give me a
<i>tishcara</i>, or local passport, which, however, he did not
dare to record; off in the country it served me well.&nbsp; My
plan was to start on a trip through the country and seize any
opportunity that might offer of getting to Egypt.&nbsp; I started
from the Damascus Gate, my faithful horse being my only
companion.&nbsp; We travelled first to Nablous, the ancient
Sichem, and finding that the Samaritans were soon to keep their
passover, I waited to see their celebrated <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>sacrifice.&nbsp; Each family took a lamb, and they went
out and pitched their tents on Mount Gerizim before the tomb of
Sichem, the son of Hamor, whom they hold in great reverence, and
camped out there for eight days.&nbsp; On the first day their
high-priest sacrificed a lamb for each family, and every day he
himself mixed the unleavened cakes.&nbsp; Leaving Nablous, I
struck across country till I came to an Arab village on the
Jordan, and then followed its course until I came to
Tiberias.&nbsp; Along this part of the country many of the
villagers knew me, and wherever I was acquainted they entertained
me freely with their proverbial hospitality.&nbsp; At one Bedouin
encampment they insisted on roasting an entire sheep.&nbsp; This
they did in a very primitive fashion.&nbsp; They dug a ditch in
the earth, and made fire within it until it was very hot, and
then, removing the fire, they laid the lamb, well seasoned, on
the hot ashes, and then buried it for a couple of hours.&nbsp; It
then made a very savoury dish, of which we all partook, dipping
into the same dish.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tiberias is one of the four sacred cities of the Jews,
and there I found a large number residing.&nbsp; It is also a
favourite resort because of its hot springs of healing
qualities.&nbsp; I had left Jerusalem almost ill, and so was very
glad to take a course of baths here.</p>
<p>&lsquo;From Tiberias I journeyed towards Nazareth, and visited
the Tomb of Jethro, near the horns of Hassau, where probably our
Lord preached His wondrous Sermon on the Mount.&nbsp; At Nazareth
I was hospitably entertained at the Latin Convent, and a priest
showed me all the sights of the town.&nbsp; Next day 400 or 500
French pilgrims arrived, and I shared their entertainment.</p>
<p><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>&lsquo;After three days I resumed my journey, with the
intention of embarking at Haifa and passing on to Egypt without
being seen at Jaffa.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in due time the writer made his escape, and was welcomed
in America, mainly owing to the assistance of Mr. Ben Oliel, who
had been the means of his conversion.</p>

124</span>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">ALEXANDRIA.</p>
<p>We left Jaffa on the Monday, and in twenty-four hours after
were landed at Alexandria.&nbsp; Alexandria is not a desirable
place to land at; travellers have to trust generally to native
boatmen, who are a race of robbers.&nbsp; For instance, an
American gentleman described to me how it fared with him on
attempting to land a few years since.&nbsp; He and a friend made
a bargain with a respectable man to put them ashore.&nbsp; He
called a boatman, into whose boat they got with their
luggage.&nbsp; No sooner had the man rowed a little way from the
ship than he stopped and demanded the instant payment of a sum
four times the amount that had been agreed upon.&nbsp; The
travellers said they had made an agreement with his master, and
he was bound to carry it out.&nbsp; He replied that he had no
master; that the boat was his, that the oars were his, and that
he would neither take them back to the ship nor row them ashore
unless they complied with his request.&nbsp; One of the gentlemen
had a revolver, which he held at the rascal&rsquo;s head, telling
him to prepare for instant death.&nbsp; The man sullenly obeyed,
but no sooner had he reached the shore than he <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>landed and
preferred against the travellers a charge of attempting to murder
him.&nbsp; The affair promised to be serious, but it was
discovered by the judge that the revolver was not loaded, nor
ever had been loaded, and the travellers were at length allowed
to depart in peace.&nbsp; I heard of another case of a Frenchman
shooting his boatman, who refused to fulfil his contract.&nbsp;
In my case, happily, I landed on the quay, and had no trouble
with the boatmen at all.</p>
<p>At length I am fairly landed in the land of the
Pharaohs&mdash;a land whose records are engraved in stones, and
date thousands of years before the birth of Christ.&nbsp; You see
nothing of Alexandria till you approach it, and then it spreads
out before you in all its charm, from Pharos, the most ancient
lighthouse in the world, on one side, to Pompey&rsquo;s Pillar on
the other.&nbsp; Soon after I land at the quay, I make my way to
the railway-station in a carriage and pair, for which I had
agreed to pay a shilling.&nbsp; At the station the driver has the
impudence to demand two shillings, which I refuse to give, whilst
a dragoman, who has fastened himself on to me, though I have
attempted to get rid of him, demands a shilling for his
unnecessary attendance.&nbsp; I offer him threepence; he is
indignant.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am a dragoman,&rsquo; he exclaims in an
angry tone.&nbsp; &lsquo;What do you take me for?&rsquo;&nbsp; At
length I give him sixpence, and he goes away in peace.&nbsp; I
smoke my first pipe of excellent Egyptian tobacco, swallow a tiny
cup of coffee, all sugar and grounds, and survey the scene from
the outside of the excellent railway-station, which is a credit
to the city.&nbsp; Every minute a blacking boy begs me to let him
clean my boots, but as I need not his services they are
declined.&nbsp; On my way I have seen <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>every sign of industry and wealth:
spacious shops, and a fine square adorned with handsome houses,
and with a good statue of Ibrahim Pasha&mdash;the man to whom
modern Egypt owes its first dawn of revived prosperity.&nbsp; The
municipal authorities of the place have 
<a href="images/p126b.jpg">
<img class='floatright' alt=
"Pompey&rsquo;s Pillar, Alexandria"
title=
"Pompey&rsquo;s Pillar, Alexandria"
src="images/p126s.jpg" />
</a>done much to promote its prosperity.&nbsp; The traveller will
find it to his advantage to stop here a day or two.&nbsp; The
hotels are excellent, and, with one exception, by no means
dear.&nbsp; The harbour is full of shipping and steamers, and the
number of trains laden with merchandise running between Cairo and
<a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>Alexandria seems incessant.&nbsp; The railway-carriages
are an immense improvement on those which take you from Jaffa to
Jerusalem.&nbsp; Alexandria has a population of over 300,000, and
its prosperity has greatly increased of late.&nbsp; The English
reside principally at Ramleh, five miles off, to which there is a
local train service.&nbsp; On your way you pass the battlefield
between the English and the French, where our General, Sir Ralph
Abercrombie, lost his life in the hour of victory.</p>
<p>Commerce seems to have had her birthplace in Egypt.&nbsp; In
the time of Joseph, we read, all countries came there to buy
corn.&nbsp; Fifteen hundred years before the birth of Christ its
merchants brought indigo and muslins from India, and porcelain
from China, and the fame of its mariners was great.&nbsp; The
trade route was down the Persian Gulf, along the Tigris, through
Palmyra&mdash;the Tadmor of old&mdash;down to the cities of the
Mediterranean.&nbsp; Arab mariners also sailed from India,
keeping close to the coast till they reached Berenice, in the Red
Sea, whence the goods were transported to Captos, thence down the
Nile to Alexandria.&nbsp; &lsquo;Under such Emperors as the cruel
and dissipated Commodus,&rsquo; writes Mr. R. W. Fraser, in his
&lsquo;British India,&rsquo; &lsquo;the plundering barbarian,
Caracalla, and the infamous Heliogabalus, the wealth that came
from the East through Alexandria to the imperial city of Rome,
passed away to Constantinople and the rising cities along the
Mediterranean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The glory of Alexandria in the olden time was the Serapeum,
sacred to the worship of Serapis, a god originally worshipped in
Sinope, and brought to Alexandria by the Emperor
Ptolemy&mdash;worshipped <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>eventually by the Romans as the
Supreme Being, the beneficent Lord of Life and Death.&nbsp; It is
clear the Ptolemies&mdash;at one and the same time Egyptian
Pharaohs and Greek princes&mdash;felt the need of a real and
presiding deity for the great city, with its enormous population,
not only from Greece and its colonies, but from all the nations
and tribes of the Mediterranean and the East.</p>
<p>As the seat of a god-worship became important, so did the
deity its patron.&nbsp; When Alexandria became the official and
mercantile capital of Egypt, Serapis became the chief of all the
gods of the land, and there his shrine was worshipped for nearly
one thousand years.&nbsp; The worship of Serapis was the last to
fall before the advancing force of Christianity.&nbsp; The
philosopher saw in Serapis, writes Macrobius, nothing more than
the <i>anima mundi</i>, the spirit of whom universal nature is
the body; so that by an easy transition Serapis came to be
worshipped as the embodiment of the one Supreme whose
representative on earth was Christ.&nbsp; This is clear from a
letter written by the Emperor Hadrian <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 131.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am now
become,&rsquo; writes Hadrian, &lsquo;fully acquainted with that
Egypt which you extol so highly.&nbsp; I have found the people
vain, fickle, and shifting with every change of opinion.&nbsp;
Those who worship Serapis are, in fact, Christians; even those
who style themselves the bishops of Christ are actually devoted
to Serapis.&nbsp; There is no chief of a Jewish synagogue, no
Samaritan, no Christian bishop, who is not an astrologer, a
fortune-teller, or a conjurer.&nbsp; The very Patriarch of
Tiberias is compelled, when he comes to Egypt, by one party to
adore Serapis, by another to worship Christ.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>And
this seems to show that some Christians, in order to escape
persecution, enjoyed their own faith under the cover of the
national and local worship, which was susceptible of a spiritual
interpretation quite cognate to their own ideas.&nbsp; A similar
case occurred in Spain, as the historical reader may remember,
when so many Jews, in fear of the Inquisition, nominally became
Roman Catholics.&nbsp; Accordingly, it is clear that the tone of
the higher, the fashionable society in Alexandria was to believe
that on some grander or philosophic theory all these religions
differed in form, but were essentially the same; that all adored
one Logos or Demiurge under different names, all employed the
same arts to impose on the vulgar, and all were equally
despicable to the real philosopher.</p>
<p>The worship of Serapis was abolished in the reign of
Justinian, and of the former glory of the Serapeum nothing now
remains, unless it be Pompey&rsquo;s Pillar, which was said by
some to have formed part of the Serapeum.&nbsp; According to
Tacitus, sick persons were accustomed to pass a night in the
Serapeum in order to regain their health.&nbsp; The colossal
statue of Serapis was involved in the ruin of his temple and
religion.&nbsp; It was believed that if an insult were offered to
that statue, chaos would ensue.&nbsp; When a Christian soldier
aimed his first blow, even the Christians trembled for the
event.&nbsp; The victorious soldier, Gibbon tells us, repeated
his blows; the huge idol was overthrown and broken in pieces, and
the limbs of Serapis were ignominiously dragged through the
streets of Alexandria.&nbsp; His mangled carcase was burnt in the
amphitheatre amidst the shouts of the people, and many persons
attributed their conversion to this <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>discovery of the impotence of their
great deity.&nbsp; A process something similar, attended with
similar results, has more than once occurred in the history of
missionary enterprise.</p>
<p>Deeply interesting is Alexandria from a historical point of
view.&nbsp; It was founded by Alexander the Great more than 300
years before Christ.&nbsp; King Ptolemy, the first of that name,
made it the capital of his kingdom, laid the foundations of its
enormous library, and held out inducements to men of learning to
come from all parts of the world to settle there.&nbsp; During
the siege of the city by the Romans the library was burnt, but
Antony afterwards gave the library a large collection of
manuscripts, which formed the nucleus of a second library.&nbsp;
In the early centuries of our era the town was torn with
religious dissensions about the Jews and religious dogma.&nbsp;
It was here the beautiful Hypatia, the fair heroine of
Kingsley&rsquo;s celebrated novel, was torn to pieces by an
infuriated mob.&nbsp; St. Mark is said to have preached the
Gospel here.&nbsp; It was here that there arose fierce
discussions between Arius and Athanasius and Cyril.&nbsp; The
Christians were persecuted with great severity by Decius, by
Valerianus, and Diocletian.&nbsp; The city then declined in
wealth and importance.&nbsp; Its population dwindled away.&nbsp;
All fanatics, Christian or pagan, seem to me equally to
blame.</p>
<p>It was at one time, as I have said, the headquarters of the
worship of Serapis.&nbsp; The temple stood to the east of
Alexandria, near Pompey&rsquo;s Pillar.&nbsp; It is said to have
been one of the most remarkable buildings in the world, and was
filled with excellent statues and other works of art.&nbsp; It
was destroyed by the Christian fanatic, Theophilus, during the
reign <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>of
Theodosius II.&nbsp; Gibbon describes the prelate as &lsquo;a
bold, bad man, the perpetual enemy of peace and virtue, whose
hands were alternately polluted with gold and blood.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The library of the Serapeum is said to have contained about
400,000 manuscripts; at any rate, when it was burnt by the
command of the Khalif Omar, the manuscripts were said to have
been sufficiently numerous to heat the public baths for six
months.&nbsp; Perhaps it is as well they were not all
preserved.&nbsp; Of making many books there is no end, and many
are the books published in this intelligent age, the burning of
which would be no loss, but a gain, to the reading public.&nbsp;
Among the famous men who studied in the original library of
Alexandria were Strabo, Hipparchus, Archimedes, Plato, and
Euclid.</p>
<p>Then came the blighting rule of the Turk, and the wise men
moved away.&nbsp; They are all vanished&mdash;gone; in their
place have come the Jew banker, the tradesman, and the merchant
prince.&nbsp; The people amuse me.&nbsp; They wear the cotton
tunic longer, and have a more Arabian cast of feature than the
Jews.&nbsp; I see a funeral, with a long line of women
following.&nbsp; I see a Turk at his devotions.&nbsp; He spreads
a small carpet before him, then raises his arms above his head,
muttering something all the while; then he bows his body so that
the head touches the ground, and so he goes on.</p>
<p>In a little while we are off for Cairo, or Caire, as they call
it here.&nbsp; On my way I get my first glimpse of one of the
branches of the Nile, one of the largest, and certainly the most
renowned, rivers in the world.&nbsp; In a few days I see more of
the Nile, the overflow of which has not yet been dried up, and
watch the people <a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>in the mud, far too soft to admit of ploughing, hoeing
the land, rich and dark, and casting in the seed which is soon to
bear an abundant harvest.&nbsp; On our way to Cairo we pass a
fertile country, and see crops of sugarcane and rice and maize
growing, and the blue-clad fellaheen at work.&nbsp; We pass
several big towns, which seem thickly populated and full of
life.&nbsp; The houses are everywhere the same&mdash;white, with
flat roofs.</p>
<p>As originally founded, Alexandria was only equalled by Rome
itself.&nbsp; It comprehended a circumference of fifteen miles,
and was peopled by 300,000 free inhabitants, besides at least an
equal number of slaves.&nbsp; The lucrative trade of Arabia and
India flowed through its port to Rome and the provinces.&nbsp; No
one lived an idle life.&nbsp; There was plenty of work for all,
chiefly in glass-blowing, weaving of linen, and the manufacture
of papyrus.&nbsp; The people, a mixture of all nations under the
sun, were difficult to rule, and always ready for sedition.&nbsp;
A transient scarcity of flesh or lentils, the neglect of a public
salutation, a mistake of precedency in the public baths, or a
religious dispute, such as the sacrilegious murder of a divine
cat, was quite sufficient to create a bloody tumult.</p>
<p>Origen was a native of Alexandria.&nbsp; It was there, after
his time, that the endless controversy as to the nature of the
Three Persons in the Trinity originated&mdash;a controversy which
lasted for centuries, which led to wars and massacres, and which
finally separated the Churches of Greece and Rome.&nbsp; The
Jews, who had settled in Alexandria by the invitation of the
Ptolemies, carried the teaching of Plato into their religious
speculations.&nbsp; In time Arius arose to proclaim his idea of
the Logos, and Athanasius to oppose and protest, and <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>ultimately
triumph.&nbsp; The Homoousians prevailed, and the Homoiousians
were branded and persecuted as heretics&mdash;enemies alike to
God and man; yet Athanasius was driven from his diocese, and the
famous St. George of Cappadocia reigned in his stead.&nbsp; The
pagans of Alexandria, who still formed a numerous and
discontented party, were easily persuaded to desert a Bishop whom
they feared and esteemed.&nbsp; At a later time Cyril became the
Archbishop, and distinguished his orthodox career by the
animosity with which he expelled the Jews, and opposed the
doctrine of Nestorius, who taught that there was a Divine and
human Christ, and refused to worship the Virgin Mary as the
mother of God.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was a most expert logician,&rsquo; writes Zosimus,
&lsquo;but perverted his talents to evil powers, and had the
audacity to preach what no one before him had ever suggested,
namely, that the Son of God was made out of that which had no
prior existence; that there was a period of time in which He
existed not; that as possessing free will, He was capable of
vice; and that He was created, not made.&rsquo;&nbsp; At the
Council of Nic&aelig;a, held in the reign of Constantine, it was
decided that Christ and the Father were of one and the same
nature, and the doctrine of Arius, that Christ and God were only
similar in nature, was declared heretical.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
the Arians became more numerous than ever under the reign of
Valens.&nbsp; As soon as the Christians of the West, writes
Gibbon, had extricated themselves from the snares of the creed of
Rimini, they happily relapsed into the slumber of orthodoxy, and
the small remains of the Arian party that still subsisted in
Sirmium or Milan might be considered as <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>objects of
contempt rather than resentment.&nbsp; But in the provinces of
the East, from the Euxine to the extremity of Thebais, the
strength and number of the hostile factions were equally
balanced, and this equality, instead of recommending the counsels
of peace, served only to perpetuate the horrors of religious
war.&nbsp; The monks and bishops supported their arguments by
invectives, and their invectives were sometimes followed by
blows.&nbsp; Athanasius still reigned at Alexandria, but the
thrones of Constantinople and Antioch were occupied by Arian
prelates, and every episcopal vacancy was the occasion of a
popular tumult.&nbsp; The Homoousians were fortified by the
reconciliation of fifty-nine Macedonian or semi-Arian bishops,
but their secret reluctance to embrace the Divinity of the Holy
Ghost clouded the splendour of their triumph, and the declaration
of Valens, who in the first years of his reign had imitated the
impartial conduct of his brother, was an important victory on the
side of Arianism.&nbsp; Well might Dr. Arnold write that it was
an evil hour for the Church when Constantine connected
Christianity with the State.&nbsp; It is really wonderful that
real Christianity survived that fatal step when the sword of the
civil magistrate was drawn in its support.&nbsp; It is hardly yet
recognised that the religion of Jesus of Nazareth flourishes best
when free from State patronage and control.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">IN CAIRO.</p>
<p>Covered with dust, parched with thirst, exhausted with hunger,
burnt up with heat, I am landed at the charming H&ocirc;tel du
Nil, in the gardens of which, filled up with American
rocking-chairs, and trees bearing gorgeous red flowers and
bananas and palms, and eucalyptus and banyan-trees all around, I
realize as I have never done before something of the splendour
and the wondrous beauty of the East.&nbsp; It must have been a
fairy palace at one time or other, this H&ocirc;tel du Nil, with
an enchanted garden.&nbsp; In the day it is intolerably hot, but
the mornings and evenings are simply perfection.&nbsp; If there
be an Elysium on earth, it is this.&nbsp; I feel inclined to
pitch my tent here, and for ever bid adieu to my native
land.&nbsp; The dinners are all that can be desired, the bedrooms
large and lofty, and the servants, who, with the exception of the
German waiters, are Soudanese&mdash;tall, white-robed, with a
girdle round the middle&mdash;seem to me to be the best and most
attentive in the world.&nbsp; There is nothing they will not do
for me, and they are honest as the day.&nbsp; Apparently the dark

out to see the fine <a name="page136"></a><span

between me and the railway-station, but I cannot stand the bustle
and confusion of the street, and soon beat a hasty retreat.&nbsp;

<p>I walk outside the narrow and sombre lane which leads to the
hotel in the quaint and ancient street Mousky.&nbsp; Let me
attempt to describe it, and it will give the reader an accurate
idea of Oriental life.&nbsp; The Mousky is the busiest street in
all Cairo.&nbsp; Here meet Greek and Syrian, Anglo-Saxons,
American or English, Armenian and Turk, Maronite and Druse,
Italians, French, Russians, German, Dutch, and Belgian, and the
vast army of residents, men, women, and children, of all shades

nothing more for you to see.&nbsp; Donkey drivers, who beset me
at every step, and the guides on the look-out for their prey, are
a perpetual nuisance, even though they assure me they like the
English and are glad to see them here.</p>
<p>Crowded together are nooks and corners where native merchants
ply their trades, and the gloom of some dark recess is lit by the
glowing blue and scarlet and purple of Persian rugs, and the
glare of polished and embossed brass.&nbsp; In the street the
modern descendant of Tubal Cain is hard at work, and the tailor
plies his needle, and the cigarette-maker rolls up his tobacco in
its thin wrapper of paper, and the weaver bends over his loom,
differing in nothing from that used by his forefathers a thousand
years ago.&nbsp; Eatables and drinkables of strange flavour and
colour are exposed for sale, and pedlars meet you at every turn
uttering hoarse and discordant cries.&nbsp; There is quite a buzz
of conversation, but I cannot understand a word.&nbsp; Why, I
ask, did not Leibnitz carry out his grand idea and give us a
universal language?&nbsp; It would have saved some of us a good
deal of trouble.&nbsp; The pavement is too narrow for anyone to
walk on, as the shopkeeper sits outside smoking his cigarette,
while the customers also do the same, and the street is
completely blocked.&nbsp; You are obliged to get into the narrow
way where carriages and donkey and luggage waggons meet you at
every step.</p>
<p>Women abound, all clad in black, with a black cloth over their
faces, leaving only the eyes and nose visible, and a cheek of
pallid skin.&nbsp; The nose is covered with a little gilt
ornament, I suppose they call it, coming from the forehead, so
that you really see nothing of it.&nbsp; <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>Now and
then you pass a coffee-house where smoking and gambling seem to
be going on all day.&nbsp; In the course of my ramblings I came
to a street lined with scribes on stones writing letters for
their clients, and was struck with the firm, clear hand in which
their letters are written&mdash;all in Arabic, of course.&nbsp;
Every now and then a swell passes me in his carriage, with a
running footman to clear the way with a white or black
staff.&nbsp; I expect to be knocked down every minute.&nbsp; To
walk the Mousky in peace and safety, you require to be as deaf as
a post and to have a pair at least of good eyes at the back of
your head.</p>

<p>Wearied, I return to the quiet and shady groves of the hotel,
a large pile of buildings streaked red and yellow, with a grand
bit of garden ground at the back, and a wooden tower, from which
you may see all Cairo at a glance.&nbsp; All the houses are
flat-roofed, and many <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>of them look unfinished, though not
in reality so.&nbsp; I sink into a rocking-chair, light my pipe,
and talk of the future of Cairo.&nbsp; I say I want to visit a
Coptic Church, the church which was held heretical by the
Orthodox Church, as they were said to have held imperfect ideas
of the dual nature of Christ.&nbsp; One gentleman tells me I had
better keep away, as the priests will pick your pockets in the
very church.&nbsp; He has 300 Copts in his employ, and gives them
all a very bad character.&nbsp; I ask as to the Khedive; everyone
gives him a bad character, though he has discovered one wife is
enough for any man.&nbsp; &lsquo;He has the bad blood of his
father and grandfather,&rsquo; says an Englishman to me.&nbsp; He
has a thin veneer of civilization, but he is weak and ignorant,
eaten up with ambition, and over head and ears in debt, though
his allowance is &pound;100,000 a year, a sum which should go far
in a city where the price of labour is from two piastres to five,
the piastre being valued at twopence halfpenny.</p>
<p>The people live exclusively on maize-corn, certainly not an
expensive article of diet.&nbsp; The intelligent people are all
in favour of the English Government, but, alas! the majority does
not in Cairo, as I am told it does at home, represent the
enlightened opinions of an intelligent people.&nbsp; I hear the
shilly-shally policy of the English Government bitterly
condemned.&nbsp; We are here, and must remain here.&nbsp; As it
is, the people know not what to expect.&nbsp; There is no
progress, but a terrible paralysis all over the city.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I like you English,&rsquo; said an intelligent native;
&lsquo;but you are here to-day and may be gone to-morrow, and
then we who have adhered to England will all have our <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>throats
cut.&nbsp; We are like a boat between two shores, and know not
whither we are going.&nbsp; The English must either stop or
go.&rsquo;&nbsp; Our stay is to the lasting advantage of all the
European nations.</p>
<p>We have wonderfully improved the condition of the fellaheen,
who, according to all I hear, are not too thankful for the
liberty we have gained for them.&nbsp; I met an intelligent old
Greek, who deeply resented that we had abolished flogging&mdash;a
little of it now and then, according to him, did the natives
good.&nbsp; Manual labour is so cheap that it is used in every
department.&nbsp; At the hotel I note that they bring the coals
in in baskets, and in the railway-station I see a native employed
in laying the dust, with a skin of water, which he carries on his
back, using the neck as a water-spout.</p>
<p>Of all the cities I have known&mdash;and, like Ulysses, I am
ever wandering with a hungry heart&mdash;I infinitely prefer
Cairo, and am not surprised that it is becoming more and more the
winter residence of the English aristocracy.&nbsp; It was a
delight to live when I was there, and as I took my breakfast
<i>al fresco</i> in the beautiful grounds of the H&ocirc;tel du
Nil, with tropical plants in full flower all round me, a bright
sun and unclouded blue sky above, the question whether life was
worth living seemed to me an absurdity.&nbsp; But, alas! no one
can look for perfect happiness&mdash;at any rate, on earth.&nbsp;
In Cairo there are the flies, not so bad as I have seen them in
Australia or America, but a terrible infliction
nevertheless.&nbsp; One of my companions, Mr. Willans, the
popular proprietor of the <i>Leeds Daily Mercury</i>, suffered
much from them, and had for a time to give up reading and
writing, and to wear coloured <a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>glasses, but I was let off more
easily.&nbsp; In Cairo, for the first time, I realized what a
luxury it was to have dates to eat.&nbsp; We at home, who buy
dates at the grocer&rsquo;s, have no idea how juicy the date of
Cairo is.&nbsp; 
<a href="images/p142b.jpg">
<img class='floatleft' alt=
"Donkey Boy, Cairo"
title=

src="images/p142s.jpg" />
</a>Then the heat is great, and walking far is out of the
question.&nbsp; But what of that?&nbsp; Directly you turn into
the street the donkey-boy comes up to offer you a ride; and the
Cairo donkey is lively, large, and white, and <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>well
groomed, sure of foot, swift in speed, and beautiful to look
at.&nbsp; An English coster&rsquo;s moke is not to be named on
the same day with the Cairo donkey, on which you can have a ride
for a trifling sum.</p>
<p>Life and prosperity seem everywhere to prevail, and the
station at Cairo conducts you at once into a fine city, with
broad streets, well watered, and shaded by trees, handsome shops,
fine hotels, beautiful gardens, and the inevitable statue of
Mohammed Ali, who did so much to develop modern Egypt.&nbsp;
Palaces of all kinds attract the eye, one of the finest of these
being the residence of Lord Cromer.&nbsp; Cairo is distinctly a
society place, though, perhaps, not so much so as Cannes or Nice,
and living is dear, though cheaper than it used to be.&nbsp;
French seems the language principally used, though the guides,
who pester you at every corner, and the donkey-boys, who are
equally persistent, have a confusing smattering of English.&nbsp;
The resident English colony is chiefly composed of the diplomatic
and Consular bodies, or of those connected with the different
Consular departments, and of officers of the garrison.&nbsp; You
meet many English soldiers whose appearance is creditable to the
country, and amongst the birds of passage are many
Americans.&nbsp; There are two good clubs for visitors&mdash;the
Khediveal and the Turf, the latter chiefly supported by army
officers.&nbsp; The theatre, where French plays and Italian
operas are performed, is a very fine building.&nbsp; In the same
neighbourhood is also a <i>caf&eacute; chantant</i> in the
gardens.&nbsp; All day long, under the bright blue sky, the scene
is very animated.</p>
<p>But the visitors, although a welcome addition, do not entirely
make up Cairene society.&nbsp; The gaiety <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>begins and
is mainly kept up by the residents, especially the British civil
and military, who are always most hospitable at the winter time
of year.&nbsp; Cairo is no doubt a court and capital, the
residence of the sovereign to whom diplomatists are accredited
from all the civilized Powers.&nbsp; But it is also a British
military station, and it owes much of its present liveliness to
the British officers and civil servants.</p>
<p>It was the British garrison that established the Cairo
Sporting Club, where good polo is played, and very fair cricket,
&lsquo;squash&rsquo; rackets, and lawn-tennis; where there are
monthly race-meetings, and officers ride steeplechases on their
own horses.&nbsp; The big lunches, the pleasant afternoon teas,
the dances and flirtations so constantly in progress, are
essentially British.</p>
<p>Out at Mena, under the shadow of the Sphinx, there is a
golf-course, and the caddie is an Arab boy in a long blue
bed-gown, and you can aim your ball from the putting-green
straight at the Pyramid of Cheops.&nbsp; Out at Matarieh, just
where Mr. Wilfrid Blunt lives the life of an Arab patriarch,
under tents, surrounded by his flocks and herds, there is a
training stable, and the British sporting subaltern keeps his
&lsquo;tit&rsquo; there, and comes out to give him his gallops at
early dawn.</p>
<p>But it is as you get away from the broad streets of new Cairo,
and plunge into the bazaars and the narrow streets, that you
realize what a bewildering place old Cairo is.&nbsp; The city of
Cairo covers an area of three square miles, and greatly exceeds
the limit of the old walls.&nbsp; On the south stands the ancient
citadel, on a rock, memorable for the massacre of the
Mamelukes.&nbsp; Of the most perfect of the old gateways still <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>remaining
is the Gate of Victory.&nbsp; Above the archway is an Arabic
inscription: &lsquo;There is no god but God, and Mohammed is His
Prophet.&rsquo;&nbsp; The streets are narrow and irregular, and
badly paved, while the white houses, with their overhanging
windows, are, at any rate, picturesque.</p>
<p>The bazaars are of all sorts: the leather-sellers have one,
the carpet-dealers another, silk-merchants another, and
everywhere purchaser and buyer seem to spend a great deal of time
in smoking cigarettes.&nbsp; The gold bazaar is so narrow that
three persons can scarcely pass; there, and at the silver bazaar,
you see the artificers constantly at work.&nbsp; Coptic churches
and mosques you meet everywhere.&nbsp; There is a good attendance
at the English Church; there are also a Presbyterian Church, and
two Roman Catholic churches.&nbsp; I saw the bishop of one of
them, who was to preach, driving along in very grand style.&nbsp;
The Wesleyans have also a chapel.&nbsp; The howling dervishes
have also their sanctum, where they exhibit their peculiarly
unpleasant powers.&nbsp; I decline to go and see them, as
everyone tells me they are a fraud; and if I want to be deceived,
there is the Egyptian conjuror always ready with his little
tricks.&nbsp; He comes daily to the hotel to give a performance;
also daily resort there the Egyptian minstrels, whose
performances we all greatly applaud.</p>
<p>The English have a party paper called the <i>Sphinx</i>,
which, however, I fancy has little influence in the formation of
public opinion.&nbsp; In Alexandria a daily English paper is
published, which reaches Cairo about eight in the evening, but
which gives little general news, and is chiefly devoted to trade
and commerce.&nbsp; <a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>It was with a heavy heart I left
Cairo and its bright and busy life for the gray skies and bleak
winds of my native land.&nbsp; My consolation is that we breed
better men than they do in southern climes&mdash;a fact of which
the Roman C&aelig;sars were aware when they drew their best
troops from Britain or Northern Gaul.</p>
<p>The French complain bitterly of English influence in
Egypt&mdash;a country for which we have done much, and which, if
it ever becomes prosperous, will owe its prosperity to England
alone; and yet it is the fact that the Englishman in Egypt lies
under peculiar disadvantages, and that as much as possible
English enterprise is discouraged and destroyed.&nbsp; It ought
not to be so.&nbsp; We who have made Egypt what it is, who have
fought its battles, developed its resources, improved the
condition of its people, destroyed its corrupting and enervating
influences, put its finances in a healthy condition, may be
expected to have, at any rate, fair play there.</p>
<p>That this is not so, the case of Mr. Fell, of Leamington, one
of the few men who have raised themselves from the ranks and
become honoured far and near, is a notorious illustration.&nbsp;
In 1890 he obtained a concession from the Egyptian Government
giving him the right to make tramways in the city of Cairo.&nbsp;
The particular department of the Egyptian Government which has to
do with such affairs has at its head a Secretary of
State&mdash;at that time the office was held by Sir Colin Scott
Moncrieff&mdash;and a financial adviser appointed by the Egyptian
Government on the recommendation of the English Government.&nbsp;
Mr. Fell went to Egypt, had the whole city surveyed, and the
plans drawn, a difficult task which occupied a considerable <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>amount of
time.&nbsp; In August of the same year he bought the steel rails,
ordered the cars to be built, and did all he could to hasten the
fulfilment of his contract, and, as a security, deposited with
the Egyptian Government twenty-two Egyptian bonds of the value of
&pound;100 each.&nbsp; To still further strengthen his position,
he had a letter from Sir Colin Scott Moncrieff to the effect that
he was quite satisfied that Mr. Fell had complied with legal
requirements.</p>
<p>So far all was straight sailing, but in April the Egyptian
Government confiscated the bonds Mr. Fell had deposited with
them, and also declared the contract null and void, on the ground
that he had failed to comply with the conditions under which the
contract was made.&nbsp; Mr. Fell had a long correspondence with
the Egyptian Government of a very unsatisfactory character.&nbsp;
In 1893 he returned to Egypt, and interviewed the
authorities.&nbsp; Lord Cromer advised him to go to law.&nbsp; In
his action against the Government, he was defeated on the plea
that the letters written by Sir Scott Moncrieff, as Secretary of
State, were not valid.&nbsp; In the meanwhile, the Egyptian
Government advertised for a new concession in July, 1894, for
which Mr. Fell again tendered, depositing a thousand
guineas.&nbsp; In compliance with a request from the Egyptian
Government, Mr. Fell again returned to Egypt, but found, on his
arrival, that the contract had been given to a Belgian firm, who
frankly admitted that they had paid so much for the concession
that it was scarcely worth having.&nbsp; &lsquo;My loss in
consequence,&rsquo; said Mr. Fell to me, &lsquo;is at least from
&pound;17,000 to &pound;20,000, and this all through French
intriguing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such is a brief outline of a case of hardship, not <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>to an
individual, but the whole nation.&nbsp; Practically speaking,
there is no British capital invested in Egypt except what was
there previous to 1882.&nbsp; In the railway department, for
instance, of late years all the works have been carried on by
French and Belgian&mdash;to the exclusion of
British&mdash;contractors.&nbsp; All the contracts for bridges
which have recently been let have been let to Belgian
contractors.&nbsp; The only companies that thrive in Egypt are
French companies.&nbsp; Everything is in their favour.&nbsp; The
law officers of the Crown are exclusively foreign, principally
Corsicans, and they are able to control the native tribunal,
notwithstanding the fact that there are English judges upon it;
and to these Corsican law officers it is due that so much
anti-English feeling exists in Egypt at this present time.&nbsp;
Assuredly, Egypt makes us but a poor return for the money and
blood we have spent in its behalf.&nbsp; We have a right to
expect better treatment.&nbsp; If John Bull stands this sort of
thing, he must be a poor creature indeed.</p>
<p>Anthony Trollope gives us an amusing illustration of the
official life of Cairo in his time.&nbsp; He was sent there by
the English Post-Office to accelerate the mail-service to Suez,
and it took him two months to do his business.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
found, on my arrival,&rsquo; he writes, &lsquo;that I was to
communicate with an officer of the Pasha, who was then called
Nubar Bey.&nbsp; I presume him to have been the gentleman who
lately dealt with our Government as to the Suez Canal shares, and
who is now well known as Nubar Pasha.&nbsp; I found him a most
courteous gentleman, an Armenian.&nbsp; I never went to his
office, nor do I know that he had an office.&nbsp; Every other
day he would come to me at my hotel, and bring <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>with him
servants and pipes and coffee.&nbsp; I enjoyed his coming
greatly, but there was one point on which we could not
agree,&rsquo; and that was as to the rate of speed with which the
mails should be carried through Egypt.&nbsp; The Post-Office said
it must be done in twenty-four hours.&nbsp; The agent of the
Egyptian Government contended that it would take forty-eight
hours at the least.&nbsp; For a long time they could come to no
agreement.&nbsp; Both were equally obstinate.&nbsp; It was
impossible, said Nubar, that the mail could be carried at such a
rate.&nbsp; It might do for England, but would not do for
Egypt.&nbsp; The Pasha, his master, he said, would, no doubt,
accede to any terms demanded by the British Post-Office, so great
was his reverence for anything British.&nbsp; In that case, he,
Nubar, would at once resign his position and retire into private
life.&nbsp; He would be ruined, but the loss of life and
bloodshed which would follow would not rest on his head.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, he gave way after many days&rsquo; delay and a good
deal of smoking and coffee-drinking.&nbsp; The twenty-four hours
gained the day.&nbsp; It is to be hoped that official business is
done more quickly now.&nbsp; A two months&rsquo; stay in Cairo
over such an affair may have been pleasant.&nbsp; It certainly
was expensive, and someone other than Mr. Trollope had to pay the
bill.</p>
<p>Lord Cromer&rsquo;s latest report of the state of matters in
Egypt is cheering.&nbsp; The finances are better.&nbsp; The
income from railways, customs, and tobacco has improved.&nbsp; A
great boon has been conferred on the fellaheen by the
experimental money advances made by Government to tide them over
till their cotton-crop is ripe.&nbsp; Hitherto they have had to
borrow from Greeks, who, however admirable in the character of
liberators, <a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>are not so lovely as money-lenders.&nbsp; They charge
from 20 to 30 per cent. for their loans, and, in addition, always
take back an Egyptian pound, equal to &pound;1 0s. 6d., for the
pound sterling.&nbsp; This is really more than an extra 2&frac12;
per cent., for the loans are not for a whole year.&nbsp; There
are Mohammedan lenders, too.&nbsp; Their religion forbidding
usury, they take it out of the fellaheen in cotton.&nbsp; The
Government in their experimental loans have charged a half per
cent. per month, or 6 per cent. per annum.&nbsp; The experiment
was successful.&nbsp; Of nearly &pound;8,000 lent between
February and July, all but &pound;20 had been repaid with
interest by the end of November.&nbsp; The benefit that an
agricultural bank would be to the smaller cultivators has been in
this way realized by Lord Cromer, who suggests that private
bankers should take the experiment in hand.</p>
<p>The Government has also been checkmating the money-lenders by
sending them good seed at 58 pounds Turkish an ardeb, payable in
three instalments, upon finding out that the usurers were
advancing inferior seed at 70 to 100 pounds Turkish, payable at
cropping-time.</p>
<p>The land-tax is now got in with certainty, whereas formerly
the Government never knew what to estimate for arrears; the
post-office revenue is improving; exports and imports have gone
up by about two millions; the cotton-crops are better; the sugar
industry is rapidly increasing in Upper Egypt; the railway
receipts are the highest on record; railway extension is going
on, and plans and surveys for light railways are well advanced;
agricultural roads are constructed; there are electric tramways
and lighting in <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>Cairo.&nbsp; The light dues will be decreased this
year.&nbsp; The only relic of forced labour is a yearly
diminishing amount for the protection of the Nile banks during
the period of flood.&nbsp; Crime is diminishing, and sanitary
reform is progressing.&nbsp; Education is advancing as far as
possible, considering the deficiency of funds, and slavery is
kept under.</p>
<p>As to the question when our work shall be done, and we English
shall retire from Cairo, it is impossible, says Sir A. Milner, to
give a definite answer.&nbsp; It would be difficult to
over-estimate what that work owes to the sagacity, patience, and
fortitude of the British Ambassador.&nbsp; The contrast between
the Egypt of to-day and the Egypt as it was when he first took it
in hand is the best testimony to his efficiency and wisdom.&nbsp;
All writers on Egypt agree in this.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is not a
native,&rsquo; writes Mr. Wood, &lsquo;that does not recognise at
heart the benefits of the British occupation&rsquo;&mdash;a
remark which seemed to be to a certain extent true; but not quite
to the extent Mr. Wood suggests.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is quite an
anachronism,&rsquo; Sir A. Milner remarks, &lsquo;to suppose that
the interest of Egyptian finance centres in the debt, and that
the financial authorities of the country are the mere bailiffs of
the bondholders.&rsquo;&nbsp; As a matter of fact, now that it
has been established that the resources of Egypt can bear the
interest of the debt at its present rate, the last people whom an
Egyptian Finance Minister need trouble himself about are the
bondholders.&nbsp; Except when an occasion presents itself to
reduce the interest by the legitimate method of conversion, the
debt need no longer have a foremost place in his mind.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Even the Commissioners of the Caisse,&rsquo; writes Sir A.
Milner, &lsquo;who only meet to <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>protect the creditors, and who from
time to time, to justify their existence, get up a little fuss
about some supposed danger to interests which in their hearts
they know to be perfectly secure&mdash;even the Commissioners of
the Caisse, I say, are more occupied now-a-days with employing
their reserve fund in developing the wealth of the country than
with needless anxieties about the coupon.&rsquo;&nbsp; Sir A.
Milner has no doubt well weighed his words.&nbsp; Of all the
romances of finance there are few to be compared with the
borrowings of Ismail, to whom is due the honour of having
originated the Egyptian National Debt.</p>

153</span>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">THE PYRAMIDS AND THE SPHINX.</p>
<p>There are two things in Egypt which amply repay the traveller
for his trouble.&nbsp; One is the museum at Gizeh, and the other
the pyramids, especially the Great Pyramid of Cheops.&nbsp; I did
them both in one day.&nbsp; It is a pleasant ride from Cairo, on
a road broad, well watered, and shaded all the way by large
acacia-trees.&nbsp; I did the museum first, though it will be a
matter of regret to me that I had only an hour to visit a
collection where one might usefully spend weeks, and that our
guide indulged in an English almost as unintelligible to us
as</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The
heathen Greek<br />
That Helen spoke when Paris wooed.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The palace which shelters the museum is said to have been
built at a cost of nearly 5,000,000 sterling.&nbsp; The edifice
is placed in spacious grounds close to the river, just opposite
the spot on the other side where Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter is said
to have come to bathe when she discovered Moses.&nbsp; It was
opened by the Khedive in 1890.&nbsp; The section devoted to the
exhibition of papyri is remarkably interesting, but to most of us
the gem of the collection is the splendid sarcophagus which <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>contains
the body of Rameses II., the persecutor of the Israelites.&nbsp;
The features of his face are well preserved, but his head does
not give you any idea of any special intellectual capacity; and
the face of his father, who lies close by, is almost that of a
pure negro&mdash;that is, as far as I could make it out.&nbsp; On
one of the papyri is an inscription, of which I copy a portion,
in order to 
<a href="images/p154b.jpg">
<img class='floatright' alt=
"Colossal Statue of Rameses II"
title=
"Colossal Statue of Rameses II"
src="images/p154s.jpg" />
</a>give the reader an idea of the piety of the ancient
Egyptians:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;When thou makest an offering to God, offer
not that which He abominateth.&nbsp; Dispute not concerning His
mysteries.&nbsp; The God of the world is in the light above the
heavens, and His emblems are upon earth.&nbsp; It is unto these
that worship is paid daily.&nbsp; When thou hast arrived at years
of maturity, and art married and hast a house, forget never the
pains which thou <a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>hast cost thy mother, nor the care which she has
bestowed upon thee.&nbsp; Never give her cause to complain of
thee, lest she lift up her hand to God in heaven to complain of
thee, and He listen to her complaint.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that we have a good deal to learn of the
ancient Egyptians yet.</p>
<p>To the Pyramids it is a drive of about five miles.&nbsp; When
we reached them it was too hot for most of us to attempt
climbing; yet several of our party did so, and came back
delighted with the view they had thus gained over all the country
round.&nbsp; I need not describe the appearance of the Great
Pyramid, standing as it does on the edge of the Libyan
desert&mdash;an enormous pile of stones, up which it would be
impossible to climb were it not for the help of the guides, who
are remarkably skilful in aiding the traveller in the perilous
ascent and the far more perilous descent, and at the same time
remarkably pressing for backsheesh.&nbsp; There is no evidence to
show that the Pyramids were built for astronomical purposes, and
the theory that the Great Pyramid was built as a standard of
measurement is equally worthless.&nbsp; Outwardly, they seem
nothing but a pile of big stones, broad at the base, tapering at
the top.&nbsp; A French savant has asserted that the stones of
the three Pyramids would make a wall round the frontier of
France.&nbsp; The Pyramid of Cheops was built <span
class="smcap">b.c.</span> 3733.&nbsp; Its four sides measure in
length about 755 feet at the base; its height is now 451 feet,
but it is said to have been originally about 481 feet.</p>
<p>Of late, as I have shown, the trip to the Pyramids cannot well
be easier or more agreeable.&nbsp; In 1868 Sir <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>Stafford
Northcote thus describes his experiences: &lsquo;We observed
nothing particular till we reached the Nile, when the scene of
crossing in the ferry-boats afforded us unmixed
satisfaction.&nbsp; The usual amount of noise in the streets at
Cairo was as silence to the noise at the waterside.&nbsp; Hosts
of donkeys were being pushed, pulled, beaten, or shouted at, and
eventually lifted into the boats, and then shoved off with loads 
<a href="images/p156b.jpg">
<img class='floatleft' alt=

title=

src="images/p156s.jpg" />
</a>that looked very unmanageable.&nbsp; We had a boat to
ourselves, and our donkeys took their places in it like old
stagers.&nbsp; We had a pretty strong breeze in our favour, and
sailed across easily enough, wondering how we were to get back
again.&nbsp; Soon after crossing, we came into the fine new road
which the Viceroy has made to the Pyramids, and which is
perfectly luxurious.&nbsp; It is as wide as the Edgware Road, but
not so hard, <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

must be charming for a horse&rsquo;s foot.&nbsp; Avenues of
acacias are planted all along it, and when these have grown to
the size of those which line the earlier part of the road, the
approach will be in delicious shade all the way.&nbsp; Avenues of
trees are inferior in dignity to avenues of sphinxes, but make
pleasanter travelling.&nbsp; We were seized on in the usual way
and dragged up the Great Pyramid by the Arabs.&nbsp; I could have
got up a great deal better by myself, but it would have been
contrary to all precedent, and might have led to an
<i>&eacute;meute</i>.&nbsp; It took me twenty minutes to go up,
including a good stoppage for breath and another for a wrangle
between two Arabs.&nbsp; The view from the top was good, but one
could not enjoy it much in the presence of such a crowd.&nbsp;
The first thing my Bedouin did was to go down on his knees and
offer to cut my name, which I indignantly forbade.&nbsp; He then
proceeded to tender some coins (genuine antique, of course) at a
suspiciously low price, and finally he urged me to come down
quickly, in the hopes, no doubt, of getting hold of another
victim.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sir Stafford adds that he admired the Sphinx, which is, in
some respects, more interesting than the Pyramids
themselves.&nbsp; Now there is to be a tramway to the
Pyramids.&nbsp; But I fear the nuisance of the Arab guides
shouting and pushing will remain a nuisance still.</p>
<p>As I sit under what little shade I can find on the burning
sand, I am badgered to death by the dealers in imitation antiques
and the donkey boys.&nbsp; The white donkeys of Egypt are
beautiful animals, and sometimes fetch a hundred pounds.&nbsp; I
have seen a gentleman whose donkey cost him that sum.&nbsp; The
value of the common donkey to be met with in the streets of Cairo
<a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>is about
seven pounds.&nbsp; The finest donkeys in the world come from
Cyprus.&nbsp; The next best are those to be had at Syene, in
Egypt.&nbsp; I could tell much of the artfulness of the
donkey-boys.&nbsp; One of my companions was very stout, and did
not think it right to gallop, on account of his weight.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Me too fat,&rsquo; said he to the donkey-boy.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied the latter&mdash;&lsquo;not too fat;
you fine man.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again, one of the ladies of our party
was enjoying a ride, when the boy plaintively remarked:
&lsquo;Fine lady&mdash;fine donkey&mdash;poor
donkey-boy!&rsquo;&nbsp; And the boy secured a little extra
backsheesh.&nbsp; I could fill a chapter with the smart sayings
of the donkey-boys.&nbsp; So far as I can make out, there is no
need for the donkey-boy to travel to Ireland to kiss the
Blarney-Stone.&nbsp; Alas for him, I was deaf to all his
flattery, and plunged on in the burning sand till I stood in the
presence of the world-renowned Sphinx.</p>
<p>At first I was disappointed in the Sphinx, but, like Niagara,
the more you look, the more you admire.&nbsp; Poets and literary
men have told us how it stands in the desert, and has stood for
centuries, overlooking the eternal sands as nations and dynasties
come and go.&nbsp; In reality its position is by no means
elevated, and you don&rsquo;t see it till you are actually before
it.&nbsp; And yet one can in time realize something of that fine
passage in &lsquo;Eothen,&rsquo; written half a century ago,
which tells how this unworldly Sphinx has looked down on ancient
kings of Ethiopian and Egyptian origin, upon Greek and Roman,
upon Arab and Ottoman conquerors, upon Napoleon, dreaming of an
Eastern empire, upon battle and pestilence, and how it will
remain watching when Islam will wither away, and the Englishman
will plant a firm foot on the banks of <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>the
Nile.&nbsp; Originally it was crowned with a helmet; the stone
cap was only discovered as lately as 1896.&nbsp; Mr. John Cook
runs a four-horse coach to the Pyramids and back during the
season, and thus, at the foot of the Sphinx, the present and the
past meet and mingle.&nbsp; The age of the Sphinx is
unknown.&nbsp; All that is certain is that it was the work of one
of the kings of the ancient empire.&nbsp; A stele discovered of
the time of Thothmes, <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1533,
records that one day, during an after-dinner sleep, Hermachis
appeared to Thothmes IV., and promised to bestow upon him the
crown of Egypt if he would dig his image the Sphinx out of the
sand.&nbsp; Another inscription recently discovered shows that
the Sphinx existed in the time of Cheops.&nbsp; The Sphinx is
here hewn out of the solid rock, but pieces of stone have been
added when necessary.&nbsp; The body is about 150 feet long, the
paws are 50 feet long, the head is 30 feet long, the face is 14
feet wide, and from the top of the head to the base of the
monument the distance is about 70 feet.&nbsp; Originally there
were probably ornaments on the head, the whole of which was
covered with a limestone covering, and the face was coloured
red.&nbsp; Of these decorations scarcely any traces now remain,
though they were visible towards the end of the last
century.&nbsp; The condition in which the monument now appears is
due to the savage destruction of its features by the Mohammedan
rulers of Egypt, some of whom caused it to be used for a
target.&nbsp; Around this imposing relic of antiquity a number of
legends and superstitions have clustered in all ages.&nbsp; A
little to the south-east of the Sphinx stands the large granite
and limestone temple excavated by M. Marriette in 1853.</p>
<p><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>And
now I have done with the East, and my face is turned towards
Marseilles.&nbsp; I am once more on board the <i>Midnight
Sun</i>, the quiet and repose of which are infinitely refreshing
after the tumult and bustle of Egypt.&nbsp; Long, long will I
remember the gorgeous East&mdash;its heat, its confusion, its
noise, its undying charm.&nbsp; To enjoy Cairo, you must go and
stop there a winter.&nbsp; My fellow-passengers seem to have been
lavish in their expenditure.&nbsp; One gentleman alone of our
party expended as much as &pound;60 in the purchase of carpets
and gold-embroidered cloths, and for the ladies the bazaars seem
to have had peculiar charms.&nbsp; I am sure Dr. Lunn deserves
the hearty thanks of all our party for organizing what has proved
to be such a gratifying time.&nbsp; His brother and his
secretary, Mr. Wight, have done all in their power to make us
comfortable.&nbsp; There was no hitch in any of the
arrangements.&nbsp; Carriages and hotels were all of the very
best, and the cost of the whole trip was really remarkably
small.&nbsp; The ordinary traveller, making the trip on his own
account, must have had to pay a great deal more, and experienced
an amount of trouble and fatigue, and consequent loss of temper,
of which we passengers by the <i>Midnight Sun</i> have had no
conception.</p>
<p>The Doctor calls his tours educational ones, and provides us
with lectures.&nbsp; I did not much profit by the lectures, my
hearing being, alas! rather defective; yet we all of us got a
good deal of education during the course of our visit&mdash;the
education which comes to all of us from the use of our eyes and
ears, and the gift, or, rather, exercise, of common-sense.</p>
<p>I ought to mention that there is a very good hotel on your
right just as you get to the Pyramids; many <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>gentlemen I
met were staying there, and spoke well of it.&nbsp; Some years
since a gentleman suffering from consumption built a house, and
went to live there in the hope that the pure air of the desert
would restore him to health.&nbsp; It did not.&nbsp; As is the
case with so many consumptive people, the remedy was deferred too
long.&nbsp; Many are those who have gone to the desert to
recover, but fade away and die, to the sorrow of those who loved
them, simply because they have deferred the remedy too
long.&nbsp; On the decease of the builder of the house, it was
greatly enlarged, and is now known as the Mena House Hotel.&nbsp;
Mena is the name of one of the most ancient Egyptian kings.&nbsp;
All round it stretches the desert right away to the great Sahara,
and there Byron might have realized his dream&mdash;which,
happily, he never realized, nor ever, perhaps, wished to&mdash;of
the desert being his dwelling-place, with some fair spirit for
his minister,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Where he might soon forget the human
race,<br />
And, hating no one, love but only her.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was well for the noble poet, whose fame will grow when that
of our Poet Laureate and his brother rhymesters will have
collapsed, that the elements did not hear his prayer and accord
him his heart&rsquo;s desire.&nbsp; But a fellow might do worse
than put up at the Mena Hotel, of which I, alas! only saw the
outside.&nbsp; One ought to stop some time at the Pyramids.&nbsp;
Mr. Pollard, who devotes considerable space to them&mdash;the
last authority on the subject&mdash;says the rocks upon which
they are built, &lsquo;and the stones with which they are
constructed, abound with small fossil shells, which, from their
resemblance to money or coins, have caused <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>this
limestone to be called nummulite.&nbsp; Other round, small
shells, closely resembling lentils, are also found; the Arabs say
that they were the food of the masons turned into stone.&nbsp;
The flora is interesting, though limited: an anthromis bearing
its strong characteristic scent, but without petals; a very
pretty small plant of the herbage family; and an umbelliferous
plant smelling strongly of aniseed, were all much appreciated by
the camels and snails.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While I was there I saw no flowers, nor heard of any.&nbsp;
They had all withered under the scorching sun.</p>

164</span>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">THE RIVER NILE.</p>
<p>At length I gaze on the Nile&mdash;that marvellous river, the
sources of which, though many have tried to find them, have only
been discovered in our day.&nbsp; The history of Egypt is the
oldest known to us.&nbsp; A large portion of its history can be
constructed from the native records of the Egyptians, and those
records are all to be found on the banks of the Nile.&nbsp; Four
thousand four hundred years before Christ, Mena, the first King
of Egypt of whom we have a record, founded Memphis, having turned
aside the course of the Nile and established a temple service
there.&nbsp; In the reign of Ammenehat, 2,300 years before
Christ, special attention was paid to the rise of the Nile, and
canals were made and sluices dug for irrigating the country; the
rise of the Nile was marked on wells at Semnah, about thirty-five
miles above the second cataract, and the inscriptions are visible
to this day.&nbsp; A thousand years later Seti I. is said to have
built a canal from the Nile to the Red Sea.&nbsp; Under the Roman
Emperor Trajan the Nile and Red Sea Canal was reopened.&nbsp;
Egypt proper terminates at Syene: the territory south of that
town and each side of the new Nile is called <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>Nubia.&nbsp; All Egypt depends upon the Nile; where the
Nile does not flow all is barrenness&mdash;nothing but sand and
rock.</p>
<p>The area of the land in Egypt available for cultivation is
about 11,500 square miles; the Delta contains about 6,500 square
miles, and the Nile Valley about 5,000.&nbsp; The country seems
to have been taken possession of by a people from the East about
5,000 years before Christ.&nbsp; They found there an aboriginal
people, with a dark skin and complexion.&nbsp; The Egyptians
generally called their land black (Kanit), and the term is
appropriate, if we consider the dark rich colour of the
cultivated land.&nbsp; In the Bible Egypt is known as Ham.&nbsp;
All nations have held the land, and have sent their people
thither.&nbsp; But it is a curious fact that the physical type of
the Egyptian fellah is exactly what it was in the earliest
dynasties.</p>
<p>The river Nile is one of the largest rivers in the
world.&nbsp; It is formed by the junction of two great arms, the
Blue Nile and the White; one rises in Abyssinia, at an elevation
of about 10,000 feet above the level of the sea; the other, the
true Nile, has its fountain-head in the Victoria Nyanza, a huge
basin far below the level of the country.&nbsp; The course of the
Nile has been explored about 3,500 miles.&nbsp; From Khartoum to
Cairo the Nile falls about 400 yards; its width in its widest
part is about 1,100 yards.&nbsp; After entering Egypt, the Nile
flows in a steady stream always to the north, and deposits the
mud which is the life of Egypt.&nbsp; The breadth of the Nile
Valley varies from four to ten miles in Nubia, and from fifteen
to thirty in Egypt.&nbsp; The width of the area of cultivated
land on each bank of the river in Egypt is never more than eight
or nine <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>miles.&nbsp; The inundation caused by the descent of
rain on the Abyssinian mountains commences at the cataracts in
June, and in July makes a great show.&nbsp; The rise of the Nile
continues till the end of September when it remains stationary
about three weeks.&nbsp; In October it rises again, and attains
its highest level.&nbsp; When I saw it in November the waters had
subsided, and the peasants were hard at work, making the best of
their opportunity.</p>
<p>The ground was still too wet for ploughing, but gangs were
turning up the soil with hoes, and sowing the seed.&nbsp; It
seemed to be simple work, under the blue sky and the bright
sun.&nbsp; There was no need for high farming; Nature did
everything, and the toil of the labourer was richly
rewarded.&nbsp; It made me think of what Douglas Jerrold said of
Australia&mdash;that it was a country so fertile that &lsquo;if
you but tickle her with a hoe she laughs with a
harvest.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the harvest is wonderful.&nbsp;
Commercially, the Nile is a fortune to Cairo.&nbsp; It is
estimated that if all the land watered by the Nile were
thoroughly cultivated, Egypt, for its size, would be one of the
richest countries in the world.&nbsp; Till the Cairo Waterworks
were established, the people of Cairo depended solely on the
water of the Nile; and in Cairo, as in Jerusalem, the
water-carrier is still to be seen, bearing on his back a large
black goatskin filled with water from the river.&nbsp; At the
Cairo railway-station he is always in evidence watering the
platform and keeping down the dust.&nbsp; The short legs of the
goat cut off at the knee stick out in a most grotesque manner
when the skin is full and round.&nbsp; The neck forms the spout,
and is held firmly in the left hand, to enable the carrier to
sprinkle the contents where <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>desired.&nbsp; The weight of some of
these large skins must be very considerable.&nbsp; The skins used
for wine are identical in form with these.</p>
<p>In ancient times there were near Cairo no less than seven
branches of the Nile; only two now remain.&nbsp; Very busy are
the people who have to do with the Nile in the vicinity of
Cairo.&nbsp; A large open space at the end of one of the bridges
is selected for the collection of the octroi duties levied upon
all food and produce entering the city.&nbsp; Here the fellaheen
assemble daily, with their camels and asses laden with produce,
or with droves of buffaloes and oxen, and flocks of sheep and
goats.&nbsp; The scene there is almost picturesque and
animated.&nbsp; Another bridge carried over a wide canal, which
forms an important backwater to the hill, connects the western
shore.&nbsp; From this point roads radiate north, west, and
south, each shaded by avenues of the acacia, so common in
Egypt.&nbsp; The Ghizeh road is the southern one, following the
course of the river, always alive with boats with large
triangular sails, always redolent of busy life.</p>
<p>Egypt without the Nile would be a desert.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Anyone,&rsquo; says old Herodotus, the father of history,
the truth of whose narrative every day becomes more apparent to
everyone who sees Egypt, without having heard a word about it
before, &lsquo;must perceive, if he has only common powers of
observation, that the Egypt to which the Greeks go in their ships
is an acquired country, the gift of the Nile.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The prosperity of the country depends upon its inundation: if
it should prove excessive, and becomes what is termed a high
Nile, towns and villages are sometimes swept away; if it should
not rise above a <a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>certain height, it is called a low Nile&mdash;a large
area will be left uncovered, and deficient crops will be the
result.&nbsp; Fortunately, a low Nile is of rare
occurrence.&nbsp; At one time, the only way of going up the Nile
was by the dahabeah, a kind of yacht fitted up for the
convenience of travellers, an expensive and dilatory mode of
conveyance.&nbsp; Now Mr. John Cook has a line of fine steamers,
and the Nile and the journey up and down is done as safely and
expeditiously as the trip by the <i>Clacton Belle</i> steamers up
and down the Thames.&nbsp; The voyage to Assouan and back is done
in three weeks.&nbsp; Facilities are afforded the traveller for
the extension of his voyage to the second cataract.</p>
<p>Of course, the ancient Egyptians worshipped the Nile.&nbsp;
Hapi, the god of the Nile, is represented wearing a cluster of
flowers on his head; he is coloured red and green, probably to
represent the colours of the water of the Nile immediately before
and just after the beginning of the inundation.&nbsp; An
illustration of this worship occurs upon a wall in Thebes, where
a priest, in his painted robe, is offering incense, while others
play on a harp, a guitar, and two reed pipes.&nbsp; This is the
song of one of the priests who lived 1,400 years before
Christ:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Adoration to the Nile!&nbsp; Hail, to thee,
O Nile! who manifesteth thyself over this land, and comest to
give life to Egypt; mysterious is the coming forth from the
darkness, watering the orchards created by Ra (the sun-god), to
cause all the cattle to live.&nbsp; Thou givest the earth to
drink, inexhaustible one.&nbsp; Thou createst the corn; thou
bringest forth the barley, causing the temples to keep
holiday.&nbsp; If thou ceasest thy toil and thy work, then all
that exists is in anguish. . . .&nbsp; None <a

the place where he dwells; none discover his retreat by the aid
of a written spell.&nbsp; All is changed by the inundation.&nbsp;
It is a healing balm for all mankind.&nbsp; A festal song is
raised for the harp with the accompaniments of the hand,&rsquo;
etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a valuable work on the Nile, written by Wallis Budge,
Acting Assistant Secretary in the department of Egyptian and
Assyrian Antiquities, British Museum, and published by Thomas
Cook and Son, we have a beautiful illustration of the practical
side of Egyptian theology, written by a scribe called Ani, who
gives his son advice for behaviour in all the varied scenes of
life.&nbsp; It is taken from one of the papyri in the Egyptian
Museum at Ghizeh:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;If a man cometh to seek thy counsel, let
this drive thee to look for information.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Enter not into the house of another; if a man asks thee
into his house, it is an honour for thee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Spy not upon the acts of another from thy house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be not the first to enter or leave an assembly, that
thy name be not tarnished.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The sanctuary of God abhorreth noisy
declamations.&nbsp; Pray humbly, and with a loving heart whose
words are spoken silently; God will then protect thee, and hear
thy petitions, and accept thy offerings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Consider what hath been.&nbsp; Set before thee a
correct rule of life as an example to follow.&nbsp; The messenger
of death will come to thee, as to others, to carry thee away;
yea, he standeth ready.&nbsp; Words will profit thee nothing, for
he cometh&mdash;he is ready.&nbsp; Say not, &ldquo;I am a child;
wouldst thou in very truth bear me away?&rdquo;&nbsp; Thou
knowest not how thou wilt die.&nbsp; Death cometh to meet the
babe at his mother&rsquo;s <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>breast, even as he meeteth the old
man who hath finished his course.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take heed with all diligence that thou woundest no man
with thy words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Keep one faithful steward only and watch his deeds, and
let thy hand protect the man who hath charge of thy house and
property.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The man who hath received much and giveth little is as
one who committeth an injury.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be not ungrateful to God, for He giveth thee
existence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sit not while another standeth, if he be older than
thou or if he is thy superior.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whosoever speaketh evil receiveth no good.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm">THE RETURN TO MARSEILLES.</p>
<p>What memories crowd on me as I step into the tug which is to
take me and the rest of us, in a confused mass, stowed away
amidst the luggage, to the Custom House at Marseilles, a fine,
handsome building, apparently in the very heart of the town, with
shipping of many nations all around; for has not Marseilles in
our time come to be the headquarters of all those who, fearing
the Bay of Biscay, have a mind to make their way along the
historic shores, and on the blue waters of the
Mediterranean?&nbsp; As I leave the Custom House, a friend says
to me: &lsquo;I have soon got out.&nbsp; You see, there is
nothing lost by civility.&nbsp; I took my luggage to one of the
officers, took off my hat to him, and he came directly and let me
go through.&rsquo;&nbsp; I replied to the effect that I was more
successful, as I had been out a quarter of an hour before my
friend, and I never took off my hat, but simply held out my
Gladstone, which confirms me in my original idea, which, I
mention for the benefit of travellers, that the real secret of
getting one&rsquo;s examination over is simply to have nothing
for the Custom House officer to search.&nbsp; <a

that I deprecate civility; the more I travel in France, the more
I appreciate it.&nbsp; We English are a grand people&mdash;there
are no better men on the face of the earth&mdash;but we might be
a little more civil to one another.</p>
<p>And now I am in Marseilles, a clean, handsome, flourishing
city, with an enormous population and an enormous trade; and
naturally I think of the time&mdash;now more than a century
ago&mdash;when the Marseillais set out for Paris.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The notablest of all the moving phenomena of that
time,&rsquo; writes Carlyle, &lsquo;is that of Barbaroux&rsquo;s
&ldquo;six hundred Marseillais who know how to die.&rdquo;&nbsp;
A black-browed mass, full of grim fire,&rsquo; got together no
one knows how&mdash;from the <i>for&ccedil;ats</i>, say
some.&nbsp; As they march through Lyons, the people shut their
shops in fear.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Thought which works voiceless in
this black-browed mass, an inspired Tyrt&aelig;us, Colonel Rouget
de Lille, has translated into grim melody and rhythm; into his
Hymn or March of the Marseillaise: luckiest musical-competition
ever promulgated.&nbsp; The sound of which will make the blood
tingle in men&rsquo;s veins; and whole Armies and Assemblages
will sing it, with eyes weeping and burning, with hearts defiant
of Death, Despot, and Devil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Marseilles is a far nobler city than it appears to the tourist
as he rushes from the train to catch the steamer waiting to bear
him far away.&nbsp; High above the city, on a precipitous rock,
from which you have a grand view of the place, and the harbour,
and the far-off Mediterranean, stands the old Cathedral of
Marseilles&mdash;Notre Dame de la Garde&mdash;a noble Romanesque

176</span>building, with a gilt figure of the Virgin at the top,
her arms extended as if to protect the city.&nbsp; You reach it
either by a winding road or a hydraulic lift, for the use of
which you pay a trifle.&nbsp; It was there the ancient
inhabitants kept watch over sea and land.&nbsp; In time a chapel
was erected on its site, which became a place of pilgrimage for
mariners and fishermen.&nbsp; The present magnificent building
was erected in 1864.&nbsp; If only for the view, the visitor is
well repaid for his trouble.&nbsp; Hardly can you enjoy a more
magnificent prospect, embracing the fair valley of the Rhone, the
white houses of Marseilles stretching up the plain, the gray
mountains of Spain in the far distance, the dazzling blue of the
Gulf of Lyons, the dark towers of the fort, with the rocky,
picturesque islands, with the Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;If, whence,
according to Dumas, Monte Cristo made his marvellous escape,
beyond.&nbsp; In the city itself, on a hill, whence you have also
a fine view, is a grand new cathedral of imposing form and
structure.&nbsp; It was Sunday when I visited it; but there were
not many people in it, though more in the heart of the city,
where I tried to enter a church, it was so crowded that there
really was no standing-room.&nbsp; But even in Marseilles you
must be cautious when the east wind blows.&nbsp; It was there Dr.
Punshon, the greatest Wesleyan orator of our time, caught the
cold which laid the foundation of the illness that ultimately
carried him off.</p>
<p>It has a very ancient history, this noble city of
Marseilles.&nbsp; It owes its origin to a tribe of Ionian Greeks,
who, about 600 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, there founded a
town that ultimately became the head of a Roman province.&nbsp;
In the contest between Pompey and C&aelig;sar, the town <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>wished to
remain neutral, but C&aelig;sar had need of gold, vessels, and
harbours, and scrupled not for a moment to lay siege to it, which
was maintained against him during the whole of his long and
severe warfare with Afranius and Petreius in Spain, and was not
taken till after the capture or dispersion of their
legions.&nbsp; The treatment of the town was so merciless, that
from thenceforward, by Strabo&rsquo;s account, it only preserved
vestiges of its former prosperity and wealth.&nbsp; However,
Marseilles in time recovered from the blow, and chiefly by means
of the book trade.&nbsp; It seems to have become a miniature
Athens.&nbsp; France was especially distinguished by its aptitude
and zeal for Roman learning.&nbsp; At Marseilles there was an
institution for Greek education and literature, which was
visited, even in preference to Athens, by men of the highest
rank.&nbsp; A large institution of the same kind existed at
Autun, and Tacitus calls that city the principal seat of Latin
culture.&nbsp; With respect to the book trade of Lyons, we have
the testimony of the younger Pliny, when he states that he
learned, with some surprise, from a friend that his own
discourses and writings were publicly sold there.</p>
<p>In the time of the Crusades Marseilles became a busy
place.&nbsp; It is now wholly given up to trade, and flourishes
accordingly.&nbsp; Since 1850 it has become the head
packet-station on the Mediterranean, and more and more frequented
by English passengers, who can stay at gorgeous hotels, or more
economical ones, according to the state of their finances.&nbsp;
If they only stop the day, they cannot do better than dine at the
buffet attached to the railway-station, unless they wish to
partake of the famous <i>bouillabaisse</i> of which Thackeray
sung, and <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>to which my friend&mdash;my lamented
friend&mdash;George Augustus Sala, devoted many a learned
paragraph in his &lsquo;Table Talk&rsquo; in the <i>Illustrated
London News</i> and elsewhere.&nbsp; Woe is me!&nbsp; I quite
forgot all about it till just as I had to take the train to carry
me away.&nbsp; I shall never cease to regret that forgetfulness
on my part.&nbsp; It may be that I may live to repair it!</p>
<p>There was a time when this delicious delicacy could be had in
Paris.&nbsp; Some of us can still remember Thackeray&rsquo;s
beautiful ballad:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;A street there is in Paris famous,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For which no rhyme our language yields;<br />
Rue Neuve des Petits Champs its name is,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The New Street of the Little Fields.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And here&rsquo;s our wish, not rich and splendid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But still in comfortable ease,<br />
The which in youth I oft attended<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To eat a bowl of <i>bouillabaise</i>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Marseilles lives on other things than its
<i>bouillabaisse</i>&mdash;a rich soup or stew of all sorts of
fish&mdash;not to be flippantly eaten, not to be lightly
forgotten.&nbsp; Some 2,000 vessels fill its capacious
harbour.&nbsp; In its lofty bonded warehouses are stored away the
merchandise of many climes, and its soap-works and
sugar-refineries are on an extensive scale.&nbsp; In short, it is
the Liverpool of France; but, alas for the pride of the Mersey,
how much cleaner, brighter, grander! how much purer the smokeless
atmosphere! how much lovelier the outlook over sea and
land!&nbsp; It was there that in 1797 that great French
statesman, M. Adolphe Thiers, was born.&nbsp; That acute judge of
men and books, Abraham Hayward, who was at Paris before Thiers
had risen, as he did at a later time, describes him, in <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>1844, as
&lsquo;a little, insignificant man, till he gets animated, but
wonderfully clever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The one drawback to Marseilles, the only cloud in its blue
sky, is the drink; and I am glad to find that there is a good man
there, Pastor Lenoir, who has taken up temperance work, and has
carried it on very successfully.&nbsp; Last year, for a novelty,
in Marseilles he got up a temperance f&ecirc;te, which was a
great success.&nbsp; During the last twenty years drinking has
greatly increased, and the drink-shops as well.&nbsp; In 1876
there were in Marseilles 2,460 drink-shops; now there are
4,205&mdash;far too many, when we remember that the town has only
600 bakers&rsquo; shops and only 500 schools.&nbsp; As a
consequence, Dr. Rey shows that insanity has greatly increased,
and that in the hospital of St. Pierre the proportion of insane
patients whose disease can be traced to alcohol has increased
from 15 per cent. to 31 per cent. of the patients admitted.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The chief factor,&rsquo; he writes, &lsquo;of these mental
diseases is alcohol, and especially when to its intoxicating
effects is added that of absinthe, and other vegetable substances
which produce epilepsy and other similar evils.&rsquo;&nbsp; In
this respect, Marseilles teaches us a lesson which it is well to
remember at home.</p>
<p>In another way Marseilles is a lesson in favour of temperance
work.&nbsp; In the district of Villette the drinking classes
chiefly dwell.&nbsp; It is a narrow, dirty court, opening on a
series of alleys; in the centre runs an open gutter&mdash;the
only drainage of the place&mdash;while on either side are small
one-storied houses, called <i>cabanons</i>, let for about eight
shillings a month.&nbsp; They are let to the poorest of the poor,
and abound with dirt and large families and drunkenness; the
three in <a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>France, as in England, generally go hand in hand.&nbsp;
The air is stifling, the odours insupportable; and when the sun
pours down in the middle of summer, and the hot sirocco-like wind
blows, the condition of matters is unbearable.&nbsp; As I write I
see the people of Marseilles, in fear of the plague, will not
permit travellers from the East, under any pretence whatever, to
land there.&nbsp; They had much better look at home, and reform
their own sanitary arrangements in such districts as
Villette.&nbsp; It is there the good Protestant pastor,
connected, I believe, with the McAll Mission in Paris, labours
unweariedly with a band of fellow labourers as devoted as
himself.&nbsp; I give the story of one of his rescued men, as an
illustration of labour-life in the fair city of Marseilles:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Thibaut is a strong, muscular man, who
worked as a docker, and could carry 140 kilos of wool on his
shoulders from six o&rsquo;clock to twelve o&rsquo;clock without
taking rest.&nbsp; He was an inveterate drunkard, and had on one
occasion swallowed <i>thirty-five glasses of absinthe</i>,
<i>raw</i>, <i>in a day</i>.&nbsp; For thirty years he had never
set foot in a church, and his wife had died from the effects of
his ill-treatment.&nbsp; Once, in a fit of drunkenness, he threw
all that was left of furniture in their miserable home into the
street, including the stove, which was alight, and on which their
bit of dinner was cooking.&nbsp; He dragged his wife when ill
from her bed by her hair, and threw her into the street.&nbsp;
The day of her death he was found drunk in a public-house, and he
followed the remains to the grave reeling.&nbsp; He lived in the
famous &ldquo;Grand Salon,&rdquo; in a miserable hut of planks,
the most filthy hovel imaginable.&nbsp; Thibaut was not
over-scrupulous as to how he got the drink, without <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>which he
could not exist.&nbsp; There are many ways in which a docker can
steal from the cargoes he discharges without being found
out.&nbsp; For instance, there is a way of letting fall a case of
wine or cognac, so as to break one bottle, the contents of which
then can be quickly absorbed.&nbsp; Like most French workmen, he
wore trousers very baggy at the top, and tied round the
ankles.&nbsp; Such trousers can be made to hold about four pounds
of tea or coffee, or such like, and many a time Thibaut has
walked past the searchers at the dock-gates with his stock of
groceries, and has never been detected.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was nearly falling a victim to his drunken habits more than
once.&nbsp; They are now rejoicing over him at Marseilles, for he
that was dead is now alive again.&nbsp; The lost one is
found.</p>
<p>If the traveller has time to spare, let him by all means pay
Arles a visit, where there is a fine Roman amphitheatre, or
rather the remains of one.&nbsp; Very early Arles became
distinguished in Church history&mdash;I was going to say
Christian history; but, alas, at that time the bitter disputes
and dissensions in the Church bore little traces of the teachings
or the example of Christ.&nbsp; In <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 314, when, as Gibbon writes,
Constantine was the protector, rather than the proselyte of
Christianity, he referred the African controversy to the Council
of Arles, in which the Bishops of York, of Treves, of Milan, and
of Carthage, met as friends and brethren to debate, in their
native tongue, on the common interests of the Latin or Western
Church.&nbsp; One ancient writer says there were 600 bishops
there, but this is probably an exaggerated account of their
number.&nbsp; The subject, of course, was the nature of <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>the
Trinity, the discussions on which, inflamed with passion, had
filled the Churches with fury, and sedition, and schism&mdash;a
fury which excites the wonder of the modern less heated Christian
Church.</p>
<p>It was at Arles, at a later period, Constantine repaired to
celebrate in its palace, with intemperate luxury, a vain and
ostentatious triumph&mdash;his military success against the
Goths.&nbsp; It was at Arles, the seat at that time of government
and commerce, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 418, that the
Emperor Honorius, in a solemn address, filled with the strongest
assurances of that paternal affection which, as Gibbon writes,
sovereigns so often express but rarely feel, convened an annual
assembly consisting of the Pretorian Prefect of the Gauls; of
seven provincial governors, one consular and six presidents; of
the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of sixty cities; and of
an indefinite number of leading landed proprietors.&nbsp; They
were empowered to interpret the laws of their sovereign, to
expose the wishes and grievances of their constituents, to
moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes, and to
deliberate on every subject of local and national importance that
would tend to the restoration of peace and prosperity to the
seven provinces.&nbsp; It was a step in the right
direction.&nbsp; It was a step that might have tended, if
universally followed, at any rate, to retard the decay and
decline of the Roman Empire.&nbsp; But the Emperor found that the
people were not ready to accept the proffered boon.&nbsp; A fine
of three, or even five, ounces of gold was imposed on the absent
representatives.&nbsp; Honorius was in advance of his
age&mdash;in politics as great a blunder as being behind
it.&nbsp; It was not till centuries of oppression and
misgovernment that the rights of man were <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>practically
won for France, and that Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity became
the watchwords of the people.</p>
<p>Arles was very early peopled by a colony from Central Italy,
and very remarkable is the physique of its inhabitants.&nbsp; The
late Lord Malmesbury, Lord Derby&rsquo;s Minister of Foreign
Affairs, writes: &lsquo;The women are remarkably handsome, but
entirely of the Etruscan type, with magnificent dark hair and
eyes, good teeth, and fair complexions.&nbsp; They have beautiful
round throats, set on fine shoulders and busts, but their legs
are much too short for their general build.&rsquo;&nbsp; I am, of
course, not a judge of such matters, and I prefer to copy from
Lord Malmesbury, who, as a Foreign Minister and a frequent guest
both at the Courts of England and France, and a high-born
aristocrat as well, had opportunities for the pleasing study of
woman far superior to any possessed by an ordinary scribe.&nbsp;
He had a good opportunity of seeing the population, as it was a
f&ecirc;te day when he favoured the city with his presence.&nbsp;
He continues: &lsquo;There were games in the square, such as
climbing a greased pole for a leg of mutton placed at the top,
which no one succeeded in winning.&nbsp; The women were all in
costume, with black veils, worn like the mantilla.&nbsp; I
noticed that the men were remarkably plain, sallow, under-sized
and narrow-chested&mdash;in every way a remarkable contrast to
the women.&rsquo;&nbsp; As indeed they are, or ought to be, all
the world over.</p>
<p>In the neighbourhood is a hermit&rsquo;s cell, very curiously
contrived in the rock, where there was a secret way of escaping
to the deeper recesses and hiding in case of danger.&nbsp; There
was the stone bed of the hermit who is said to have been the
first to introduce Christianity <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>into the province.&nbsp; His name is
held in high esteem and a church is dedicated to his
memory.&nbsp; It was upon the plains adjoining that Charles
Martel gained his final victory over the Saracens.&nbsp; The
Roman amphitheatre in Arles is in a fine state of preservation,
with towers added in the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Soldiers have a mission hall to themselves in Marseilles,
which is full of them, and to the hall many come for peace and
light.&nbsp; The aggregate attendance is set down at nearly
6,000.&nbsp; The hall offers them a warm, comfortable room, well
lighted, with books, games, newspapers, and other
conveniences.&nbsp; A lady gives them elementary lessons in
French, arithmetic, reading, and writing.&nbsp; When the soldiers
sailed to Madagascar they took with them, in spite of the
priests, 3,000 copies of the New Testament.&nbsp; The labours of
the agents of the McAll Mission are numerous and
persevering.&nbsp; Last year they held about 500 meetings for
adults.&nbsp; They have five schools for children, besides two
sewing schools for girls.&nbsp; There are three mothers&rsquo;
meetings, with a fair attendance, and a mission choir does good
work.</p>
<p>Of more recent formation, and perhaps less well known, is the
Society of Christian Endeavour.&nbsp; It has given proof of its
existence in various ways.&nbsp; It was the Endeavourers who
organized four series of lectures, of three each, which were
given in the halls of the Grand Chemin de Toulon and the
Boulevard de Strasbourg.&nbsp; Friends were much encouraged to
see each time a large and attentive audience; the lectures had
been announced by means of handbills distributed in profusion
throughout the district.&nbsp; The society takes charge also of
the visitation of the sick, and the <a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>distribution of tracts in the
suburbs, at the gates of the factories and workshops, etc.&nbsp;
Some of the sisters have taken to heart the work among fallen
women, and in one case, at least, they have been able to snatch
one of these poor creatures from her life of sin, and place her
in a neighbouring refuge.&nbsp; And so good work gets done,
quietly and unobtrusively.</p>
<p>There were put in circulation last year through the Librairie
Evang&eacute;lique 12,000 almanacks, 4,500 Bibles and Testaments,
1,000 tracts, 1,000 books of various kinds, and 600 copies of the
<i>Rel&eacute;vement</i>.&nbsp; Open Bibles and Testaments are
constantly displayed also in the large shop-window, where the
passers-by can stop and read at their leisure&mdash;a thing which
a goodly number of them do not fail to do.&nbsp; Nor are the
Italians, of whom there are many in the town, overlooked.&nbsp;
But I pass on</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;To kinder skies, where gentler manners
reign,<br />
I turn, and France displays her bright domain;<br />
Gay, sprightly land of mirth and social ease,<br />
Pleased with thyself whom all the world can please.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And pleasant recollections come to us of Oliver Goldsmith,
who, as he tells us, oft led</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The
sportive choir<br />
With tuneless pipe beside the murmuring Loire.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The traveller who does as the writer did&mdash;leaves the
train at Marseilles, and travels home slowly, will find as much
pleasure in that little trip as in any part of his pilgrimage to
the East.</p>

186</span>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">AVIGNON.</p>
<p>Leaving Marseilles, the place at which I tarried next was
Avignon, where I had comfortable and cheap quarters at the
H&ocirc;tel Grillon.&nbsp; It was there I saw the only drunken
man that came under my notice in France.&nbsp; It was market-day,
and the town was full of country-folk, many of whom came to my
hotel for the excellent <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> provided for
guests; amongst then was an individual&mdash;not a farmer, for he
did not wear a blouse&mdash;who managed, in spite of the fact
that he had had quite enough, to consume the quart bottle of
<i>vin ordinaire</i> which, in French country hotels, every one
is supposed to take at lunch and drink.&nbsp; The allowance was
too much for me.&nbsp; The lunch in every case was so excellent
and tempting that I could not manage another heavy meal, and was
glad to content myself with tea.&nbsp; One thing surprised me at
all the country hotels, and that was the predominance of the
military element.&nbsp; At every meal there were great numbers of
officers present, and, so far as I could judge by the way in
which these sons of Mars did justice to the good things provided,
all in first-rate physical condition.&nbsp; <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>Avignon is
full of soldiers&mdash;we met them everywhere.&nbsp; All round
the place the old walls seemed turned into barracks.</p>
<p>I stopped at Avignon to see the burial-place of John Stuart
Mill.&nbsp; He was fond of Avignon, and spent a great deal of his
life there.&nbsp; I am afraid, on the whole, he was rather a
hard, cold man.&nbsp; He had a sister living in Paris, but, often
as he passed through it, he never went to see her.&nbsp; I
suppose he had learnt a good deal from Godwin&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Political Justice,&rsquo; which had a great influence at
one time among superior people, I remember, when I read it many
years ago.&nbsp; You never see the book now.&nbsp; Godwin shows
how wrong is the indulgence of social and family affection.&nbsp;
Perhaps the philosopher&rsquo;s way of looking at such things is
the right one, after all.&nbsp; As I was sitting with a friend, a
philosopher, on board the <i>Midnight Sun</i>, a gentleman, to
whom we were neither of us particularly attached, passed
us.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think I could save that man&rsquo;s
life,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why should you?&rsquo; he
asked; &lsquo;ought we not to think of the greatest happiness of
the greatest number?&rsquo;&nbsp; The reply was irresistible, and
I acquiesced.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is it not the survival of the
fittest,&rsquo; I asked myself, &lsquo;that best accords with
Nature&rsquo;s scheme?&nbsp; &ldquo;If,&rdquo; says Godwin,
&ldquo;you are in a boat with your father and a philosopher, and
you meet with an accident, you are to save the philosopher and
leave your father to perish.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mill&rsquo;s philosophy seems to have been of a similar
character.&nbsp; At any rate, his sister&rsquo;s husband
complained much, to an acquaintance of mine, of the
philosopher&rsquo;s neglect.&nbsp; But his worship of Mrs.
Taylor, who afterwards became his wife, was intense.&nbsp; They
<a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>sleep
together in the same grave in the cemetery, a mile or two out of
Avignon.&nbsp; On the tomb is the inscription: &lsquo;John Stuart
Mill, born 20 May, 1806, died 4 May, 1873,&rsquo; and that is
all.&nbsp; On the surface of the tomb&mdash;a plain white flat
one&mdash;is a long eulogium of his wife, who had died before
him.&nbsp; Her influence, the inscription records, has been felt
in many of the greatest improvements of the age, and will be felt
in time to come.&nbsp; Following her life, we are told, this
earth would become the type of heaven.&nbsp; Her death is
described as &lsquo;an irreparable loss.&rsquo;&nbsp; The grave
is separated by an iron rail from the rest, and is fringed with a
few evergreens.&nbsp; It is plain and simple, and certainly much
more in accordance with English taste than the rest.</p>
<p>One should visit the cemetery, if only to see what a French
cemetery is&mdash;all glitter and glass, for many of the flowers
placed on the tombs are under glass, and the place was quite
dazzling in the summer&mdash;or, rather, the
autumn&mdash;sun.&nbsp; The ground is carefully laid out, and
well planted with trees and flowering shrubs.&nbsp; It seems to
me of considerable extent, and people come there every day to
place fresh flowers on the graves of those they love.&nbsp; It
was early in the morning when I was there, yet a good many ladies
were engaged in their pious work.&nbsp; By most of the graves
were chairs placed for the mourners, who love to repair to such a
place.&nbsp; It is evident that family affection is strong in
France.</p>
<p>Avignon, I should think, is a pleasant place in which to
reside, with its mild atmosphere and a nice country all
round.&nbsp; There is a broad promenade (if a short one), with a
monument to a native worthy, and trees; <a

</a><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>but
away in the interior the streets are narrow and
ill-fashioned.&nbsp; It boasts a cathedral, a museum, and an
H&ocirc;tel de Ville, and tramcars run backward and forward all
day long.&nbsp; In the early days of the French Revolution it was
all for union and the &lsquo;Contrat Social&rsquo; of the worthy
Jean Jacques Rousseau; and yet it burst forth with its 15,000
brave brigands, headed by Jourdain.&nbsp; In 1789 the French
Assembly declared that Avignon and the Comtat were incorporated
with France, and that His Holiness the Pope should say what
indemnity was reasonable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papal Avignon,&rsquo; writes Carlyle, in his wonderful
&lsquo;French Revolution,&rsquo; &lsquo;with its castle rising
sheer over the Rhone-stream; beautifullest town, with its purple
vines and gold-orange groves; why must foolish old rhyming
R&eacute;n&eacute;, the last sovereign of Provence, bequeath it
to the Pope and gold tiara&mdash;not rather to Louis XI. with the
Leaden Virgin in his hatband?&nbsp; For good and for evil!&nbsp;
Popes, Antipopes, with their pomp, have dwelt in the Castle of
Avignon rising sheer over the Rhone-stream; there Laura de Sade
went to hear Mass; her Petrarch twanging and singing by the
Fountain of Vaucluse hard by, surely in a most melancholy
manner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of Petrarch, naturally one&rsquo;s thoughts turn to
Rienzi, the Italian liberator, who fell because the Roman people
were not at that time prepared for freedom.&nbsp;
&lsquo;When,&rsquo; writes Lord Lytton, in his splendid novel,
&lsquo;Rienzi,&rsquo; &lsquo;the capital of the C&aelig;sars
witnessed the triumph of Petrarch, the scholastic fame of the
young Rienzi had attracted the friendship of the poet&mdash;a
friendship that continued, with a slight exception, to the
last.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>Rienzi was one of the Roman deputies who had been sent
to Avignon to supplicate Clement VI. to remove the Holy See back
to Rome.&nbsp; It was on this mission that Rienzi for the first
time gave indication of his extraordinary power of eloquence and
persuasion.&nbsp; The pontiff, indeed, more desirous of ease than
glory, was not convinced by the arguments, but he was enchanted
with the pleader, and Rienzi returned to Rome laden with honours
and clothed with the dignity of high and responsible
office.&nbsp; No longer the inactive scholar, the gay companion,
he rose at once to pre-eminence amongst all his
fellow-citizens.&nbsp; Never before had authority been borne with
so austere an integrity, so uncorrupt a zeal.&nbsp; He had
thought to impregnate his colleagues with the same loftiness of
principle, but in this respect he had failed.&nbsp; Now, secure
in his footing, he had begun openly to appeal to the people, and
already a new spirit seemed to animate the populace of
Rome.&nbsp; According to modern historians, Petrarch and Rienzi
went to Avignon together, but, says Lord Lytton, it was more
probable that Rienzi&rsquo;s mission was posterior to that of
Petrarch.&nbsp; However that may be, it was at Avignon that
Petrarch and Rienzi became most intimate, as Petrarch observes in
one of his letters.&nbsp; Perhaps it would have been better for
Italy and better for the Roman Catholic Church had they never
returned to Rome.&nbsp; If the reader doubts this, let him read
Zola&rsquo;s &lsquo;Rome.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was in 1309 that
Clement moved his Court thither, and for sixty-eight years, until
1377, Avignon continued to be the Papal residence.&nbsp; The six
successors of Clement V., all of them Frenchmen, like himself,
were regarded by the Italians with feelings of dislike <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>and
contempt.&nbsp; They were little more than the ecclesiastical
agents of the French monarchy.</p>
<p>The climax in the history of Avignon was reached when, in
1309, Clement V. removed thither from Rome, and made Avignon the
seat of the Roman Pontiff and the metropolis of
Christendom.&nbsp; By land, by sea, by the Rhone&mdash;the
position of Avignon, writes Gibbon, was at all times
accessible&mdash;the southern provinces of France do not yield to
Italy itself; new palaces arose for the accommodation of the Pope
and Cardinals, and the arts of luxury were soon attracted by the
treasures of the Church.&nbsp; A part of the adjoining country
had long belonged to the Popes, and the sovereignty of Avignon
was purchased from the youth and distress of Jane, the first
Queen of Naples and Countess of Provence.</p>
<p>Under the shadow of the French monarchy, amidst an obedient
people, the Popes enjoyed a tranquillity to which they had long
been strangers.&nbsp; Italy deplored their loss, but the Sacred
College was filled with French Cardinals, who regarded Rome and
Italy with abhorrence and contempt.&nbsp; What remains of the
Papal Palace is now turned into barracks, of which you get a good
view from the station as you leave for Lyons or Paris.&nbsp; Dr.
Arnold, who paid it a passing visit, was struck with horror by
the sight of its dungeons.&nbsp; From Avignon the Pope prosecuted
a bitter persecution of his neighbours, the Waldenses.&nbsp; The
King of France was alarmed, and sent an officer to inquire into
the matter.&nbsp; The report was favourable.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the King, &lsquo;they are much better
Christians than myself or Catholic subjects, and therefore they
shall not be persecuted.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was as good as his <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>word, and
the Pope at Avignon had for a time to forbear, or Avignon might
have had as bloody a record as Rome itself.&nbsp; But at Avignon
they do not think of these things.&nbsp; All round the old city
are the mulberry trees and the silkworms; and the farmers want
protection for their native industry, and to keep foreign raw
silk out of the market.</p>
<h2><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">THE GREAT CITY OF LYONS.</p>
<p>In one of the first books which used to be placed in the hands
of young people when I was a lad&mdash;Fox&rsquo;s &lsquo;Book of
Martyrs&rsquo;&mdash;we get rather an unpleasant idea of
Lyons.&nbsp; &lsquo;There,&rsquo; writes old Fox, &lsquo;the
martyrs were condemned to sit in iron chains till their flesh
broiled.&nbsp; Some were sewn up in nets and thrown on the horns
of wild bulls, and the carcases of those who died in prison
previous to the time of execution were thrown to dogs.&nbsp;
Indeed, so far did the malice of pagans proceed that they set
guards over the bodies while the beasts were devouring them, lest
the friends of the deceased should get them by stealth, and the
offal not devoured by the dogs was ordered to be
burnt.&rsquo;&nbsp; After this we get a little indignant as we
turn to Gibbon, and read of the mild and beneficent spirit of the
ancient polytheism, which seems to find such favour in his
eyes.&nbsp; To-day all is changed.&nbsp; Christians, in the shape
of Roman Catholics, have it all their own way; yet one of the
handsomest places of worship I saw was that of the Reformed
Church.&nbsp; One of the earliest reformers, Waldo, the leader of
the Albigenses, was born at Lyons.</p>
<p><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>The
McAll Mission is doing a good work at Lyons, though in some
districts they have to report a falling off.&nbsp; They seek to
get hold of the children, but they find in this respect the
priests are as active as themselves.&nbsp; By means of the
<i>&oelig;uvres de patronage</i> founded by the Catholics many of
the children are drawn away.&nbsp; In one of the immense remote
suburbs of Lyons the mothers&rsquo; meeting plays an important
part in the work of evangelization.&nbsp; In many quarters
Bible-readings have been found to be very successful, and there
is a Y.M.C.A., to which many young men belong.&nbsp; As a rule,
French Protestantism is not aggressive, else it would not be what
it is to-day.&nbsp; Still, during the last few years the churches
have waked up wonderfully, and much good has been the
result.&nbsp; Be this as it may, Lyons is the finest city next to
Paris that France can boast of.&nbsp; It has a population of
about half a million, and the Rhone runs through it, adding much
to its picturesqueness, as its banks are lined with stately
houses and offices and shops.&nbsp; There are some twenty bridges
over the river, most of them very handsome.&nbsp; At night you
seem a little lonely as you watch the long rows of lamps that
glitter along the banks.&nbsp; But by day the picture is
reversed: there is busy life everywhere, and so clean and
handsome are the buildings that you can scarcely realize that
Lyons is planted with silk-mills, and that, in fact, it is the
centre of the great silk trade of France.&nbsp; The trees,
planted everywhere on the quays, which are used as promenades,
make it a very charming residence.</p>
<p>Lyons has a very ancient history.&nbsp; It was adorned by
successive Roman Emperors, and became the capital of Gaul.&nbsp;
It was the principal mart for the <a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>Western provinces of the
Empire.&nbsp; Agrippa made it the starting-point for four great
military roads that traversed Gaul.&nbsp; Suddenly it
disappeared.&nbsp; As Seneca writes: &lsquo;There was but one
night between a great city and nothing.&rsquo;&nbsp; Aided by
Nero, however, it speedily rose from its ashes.&nbsp; The city
fared badly in the decline and fall of the Roman Empire.&nbsp;
Alaric, the scourge of God, sacked it.&nbsp; In 571 the Lombards
ravaged it; in 715 the Saracens appeared, and left it a heap of
ruins.&nbsp; Under Charlemagne it became a city of light and
learning.&nbsp; Towards the end of the ninth century it came
under the rule of the Archbishops and Chapter of St. John.&nbsp;
In 1312 Philip le Bel annexed the city to France.&nbsp; The Lyons
of to-day is a stately city, splendidly situated at the junction
of the Rhone and the Saone&mdash;a junction which gave the great
Pitt a fine passage in one of his finest speeches.</p>
<p>The Lyonnais, says the writer of an excellent account of Lyons
in Cassell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Cities of the World,&rsquo; think the
Place Bellecour the finest square in Europe.&nbsp; It is planted
with trees, and ornamented with basins and fountains and two
elegant pavilions, and is a very favourite promenade of the
people of Lyons, especially when the military band plays.&nbsp;
According to some, the name is derived from <i>bella curia</i>,
and denotes the site of a Roman tribunal.&nbsp; In the Middle
Ages the Place was a muddy swamp, often covered by the waters of
the Rhone; it was gradually drained and improved by the
Consulate, and surrounded with fine buildings.&nbsp; After the
Peace of Utrecht, a bronze statue of Louis le Grand&mdash;the
King who, by revoking the Edict of Nantes, nearly ruined Lyons,
to please the Maintenon and her Jesuit <a

Revolution of 1792 the statue was pulled down and broken
up.&nbsp; Some proposed simply to replace the King&rsquo;s head
with a head of Brutus, but the multitude would not hear of
it.&nbsp; On this spot perished some of the first victims of the
fusillade in the terrible siege by the Republican army in the
following year.&nbsp; When the siege was over, Couthon set his
troop of <i>d&eacute;molisseurs</i> to work, and the beautiful
fa&ccedil;ades of the Place Bellecour were soon irretrievably
ruined, and the subsequent erections have not reproduced the
monumental character of the original buildings.&nbsp; The Place
was still covered with d&eacute;bris when, in April, 1805, the
populace of the city, upon their knees, received the blessing of
Pope Pius VII., who was then in France as the half-guest,
half-prisoner, of Napoleon.&nbsp; On March 11, 1815, the Orleans
princes hastened from the town as the advance guard of Napoleon,
returning from Elba, was crossing the Pont de la
Guilloti&egrave;re.&nbsp; On the morrow the Emperor reviewed
15,000 soldiers in the Place Bellecour, amidst the acclamations
of the populace.&nbsp; But the Empire passed away, and in 1825
the restored King placed a second statue of Louis XIV. in the
centre of the Place.</p>
<p>Churches abound in Lyons.&nbsp; One of them, that of St.
Nizien, in memory of a bishop of that name, is placed on the spot
where one of its martyr bishops, St. Pothinus, assembled his
flock.&nbsp; It has been rebuilt many times, and is interesting
not only as the cradle of Christianity in Lyons&mdash;it was also
the cradle of its civil liberty.&nbsp; Here the growing commune
met in the days of its resistance to the bishops, and the bell of
the ancient tower used to call the citizens together to elect <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>their
magistrate.&nbsp; Near the Church of Ainay was the ancient Forum,
where Greeks, Orientals, Africans, Gauls, and Spaniards met to
exchange the products of their various commerce.&nbsp; In the
Forum was an altar dedicated to the Emperor Augustus and Rome,
and near it was the Temple of Augustus.&nbsp; In the church was
sacredly preserved some hair of the Virgin Mary, and part of the
cradle and some of the swaddling clothes of our Saviour.&nbsp; In
the western part of the city, beyond the Saone, are found some
very interesting churches.&nbsp; St. Ir&eacute;n&eacute;e was
built by the Bishop St. Patient in the fifth century.&nbsp; In
the crypt is a well into which, according to tradition, the
bodies of 19,000 Christians were thrown when the Emperor Severus
revenged himself on Lyons for its adherence to the cause of
Albinus.&nbsp; Nearer to the river stands the Church of St.
Just.&nbsp; In connection with it was a vast monastery, with
massive walls and towers.&nbsp; In its cloisters many sovereigns
found a safe asylum.&nbsp; Innocent IV. was one, another was the
Regent Louise, while her son Francis I. was fighting in Italy,
and here she received the famous letter after the Battle of
Pavia: &lsquo;All is lost except honour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Still nearer to the river stands the Church of St. Jean
Baptiste, the Cathedral of Lyons.&nbsp; In one of the chapels
attached to the church was some wood of the true cross; in
another is preserved the heart of St. Vincent de Paul.&nbsp; The
Chapter of the Cathedral of Lyons was the most important body of
clergy in France; they were thirty-two in number, all Counts of
Lyons, the rank of Premier Canon being held by the reigning King
of France.&nbsp; Amongst the remarkable events that have occurred
here was the Council <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>General of 1245, when Innocent IV.
hurled the thunders of the Church against Frederick II., and
where, for the first time, the Cardinals wore the red dress to
distinguish them from other prelates.&nbsp; In 1274 a Council
General held here formed a short-lived union of the Latin and
Greek Churches.&nbsp; In this church Henry II., Emperor of
Germany, performed mass, in one of his efforts to desert his
throne and take Holy Orders.&nbsp; And here, in 1600, Henry of
Navarre renewed his marriage with Marie de Medicis.&nbsp; Close
by is the Archiepiscopal Palace, the magnificent apartments of
which have accommodated many kings and queens and eminent
personages.&nbsp; Napoleon passed a night here on his return from
Elba.&nbsp; On that awful St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s Day, in the
courtyard of the Palace, 300 Protestants were murdered.</p>
<p>Thence you ascend by steep and narrow steps to the Church of
Notre Dame, on the hill of St. Fourvi&egrave;res.&nbsp; All round
are priestly residences and numerous shop for the sale of
ecclesiastical millinery.&nbsp; Higher up are the merchants who
deal in rosaries, devotional pictures, medals, and wax models of
different parts of the body, for offerings in the church, when
the time comes for the multitudes of pilgrims who throng thither
to obtain pardon of sin and restoration of health.&nbsp; One
would have thought that an anachronism in the France of to-day;
but we know how credulity reigns rampant, in spite of the
philosopher, in every nation in the world.&nbsp; It was our
Thomas &agrave; Becket, who spent part of an exile in Lyons, who
seems to have suggested a church on this spot.&nbsp; In 1643
Lyons was ravaged by a terrible pest, and the municipality
dedicated Lyons to Notre Dame in perpetuity, and until <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>the
Revolution of 1789 the whole city celebrated, on the Feast of the
Nativity, the anniversary of the event.&nbsp; Pope Pius, in 1805,
superintended the rededication of the building to Divine worship,
and, amidst a grand display of flags, discharge of cannon, and
ringing of bells from the summit of the hill, blessed the city of
Lyons, as Innocent had done centuries before.&nbsp; In December,
1852, Lyons was <i>en f&ecirc;te</i> day and night, on the
occasion of the planting of a colossal statue of the Virgin on
the top of the tower.&nbsp; Like ancient Ephesus, it lived on its
saints.&nbsp; Happily, unlike Ephesus, it stuck to trade, and
became wealthy, and populous, and great.&nbsp; The Quai de St.
Clair is the finest in Lyons, and was formerly the rendezvous of
merchants and foreigners, and the centre of Lyonese trade.&nbsp;
One of the many quays in Lyons, that known as Les Etroit, a
charming promenade, is associated with the memory of Rousseau, in
the days of his youthful poverty.</p>
<p>Its modern H&ocirc;tel de Ville is held to be one of the
handsomest in Europe, and that is saying a great deal when we
think of Brussels or Louvain.&nbsp; Its cathedral of St. Jean
Baptiste took three centuries to build.&nbsp; The city is one of
the Roman Catholic strongholds, and to some of its churches
resort every year as many as 1,500,000 pilgrims, who obtain
similar privileges to those accorded to the devotees at
Loretto.</p>
<p>Now that Lyons is at peace, it exports to England, America,
and Russia, manufactured silks to the amount of &pound;18,000,000
yearly.&nbsp; It is to Jacquard that it owes its silk
manufacture, and a statue of him properly graces the city.&nbsp;
For many years it had been renowned for its manufactures, but in
1802, a workman originally, Jacquard lived to revolutionize <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>the silk
trade, and laid the foundation of its present prosperity.&nbsp;
Its workshops for the construction of machinery, its
manufactories of chemical products and coloured papers, are
justly celebrated; but it is from the production of its silk
fabrics that Lyons derives its chief fame.&nbsp; This industry,
in which Lyons has no rival, was first brought from Italy.&nbsp;
Florentines, Genoese, and others, driven away by revolutions, did
for France what in after-times expatriated Frenchmen did for
other countries to which they were compelled to flee by reason of
tyranny at home.&nbsp; By decree of Louis XI., experienced
workmen settling at Lyons were exempt from taxes levied on other
inhabitants.&nbsp; Twelve thousand silk-weavers were busy at work
in Lyons by the middle of the sixteenth century.&nbsp; At the
Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, it seemed as if the silk
industry was about to be annihilated.&nbsp; More than
three-fourths of the looms were silenced; but in the course of a
couple of generations the industry resumed its former
proportions, and steadily increased, till Lyons became <i>par
excellence</i> the city of beautiful silks.&nbsp; The Lyonnese
silk-weavers mostly work in their own dwellings.&nbsp; A man with
his family will keep from two to six or eight looms going, often
employing journeymen.&nbsp; The silk-merchants of Lyons, about
600 in number, supply the patterns and the silk; there are about
40,000 looms at work in the city and in the vicinity.&nbsp;
Formerly, the weavers were nearly all grouped together in the
northern part of the city, but the employers, in order to lessen
the influence of the close trade organizations, have succeeded in
distributing the industry throughout the neighbouring villages,
though La Croix-Rousse <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>still holds the lion&rsquo;s
share.&nbsp; Its silks still maintain their prestige.&nbsp; The
Empress of Germany last year purchased at Lyons white silk, with
flowers, birds, and foliage in relief, at twenty-five pounds a
yard, five-sixths of the price being the actual value of the raw
silk.&nbsp; She intended to have a dress made of it, but it was
so beautiful that she used it for a curtain.&nbsp; This is
believed to be the highest priced silk goods ever made.&nbsp;
Louis XIV. paid twelve pounds a yard for the cloth-of-gold
material of which his dressing-gown was made.&nbsp; Lyons has
been the birthplace of many distinguished and illustrious
personages&mdash;Germanicus, and the Emperors Claudius and Marcus
Aurelius, the philosopher-king; the ruler who preferred the
solitude of the student to the splendour of the palace; the
soldier who loved the arts of peace better than the glory of war;
who left to the world his &lsquo;Meditations,&rsquo; which, even
at this era of the world&rsquo;s history, it does us good to
read.&nbsp; Another native of Lyons whose works were at one time
much read in England was J. B. Say, the famous political
writer.&nbsp; Another of the modern glories of Lyons was Louise
Lab&eacute;, the Lyons Sappho, surnamed La Belle
Cordi&egrave;re.&nbsp; Another was Roland, the great statesman,
the husband of a yet more illustrious wife.&nbsp; Iren&aelig;us,
Bishop of Lyons, was one of the victims of what Fox terms the
fifth general persecution, and it is generally supposed that the
account of the persecution in Lyons was written by him.&nbsp; He
was beheaded in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 202.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lyons,&rsquo; says the Guide-Book, &lsquo;embraced with
ardour the cause of the Revolution, and it suffered frightfully
in consequence; but the Patriots knew nothing of the dark days to
come, as they formed <a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>one bright May morning the
Federation of Lyons, in which some fifty or sixty thousand of its
citizens took part.&nbsp; What a picture Carlyle gives us of the
Lyons guardsmen meeting at five on the Quai de Rhone, marching
thence to the Federation Field, amid waving of hats and
ladies&rsquo; handkerchiefs, great shoutings of some two hundred
thousand patriot voices and hearts&mdash;the beautiful and brave!
&lsquo;amongst whom, courting no notice, and yet notablest of
all, what queen-like figure is this, with her escort of house
friends and Champagneux, the Patriot editor?&nbsp; Radiant with
enthusiasm are those dark eyes in that strong Minerva face,
looking dignity and earnest joy&mdash;joy-fullest she where all
is joyful!&nbsp; It is Roland de Plati&egrave;re&rsquo;s wife;
that elderly Roland, King&rsquo;s inspector of manufactures here,
and now likewise, by popular choice, the strictest of our new
Lyons Municipals&mdash;a man who has gained much, if worth and
faculty be gain; but, above all things, has gained to wife
Philipon, the Paris engraver&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; Reader, mark
that queen-like burgher woman, beautiful, graceful to the eye,
much more so to the mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lyons had a bitter awakening&mdash;famine, ruin, and despair;
a long siege and an awful doom.&nbsp; The cry in Paris is,
&lsquo;Lyons has rebelled against the Republic; Lyons is no
more.&rsquo;&nbsp; The infamous Fouch&eacute; is there, and the
hangman follows.&nbsp; There is no end to the fusillading and
filibustering, and mangled corpses float down the Rhone.&nbsp;
The picture is too awful; let us draw the curtain, and think of
Madame Roland, as in her grace and glory she helped to
give&mdash;alas! in vain&mdash;freedom to Lyons and to
France.&nbsp; I think of her as I take the train, and bid adieu
to a city so splendid <a name="page205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>and so replete with associations,
some pleasant, others much the reverse.&nbsp; Under the Consulate
and the Empire Lyons once more rose to life and prosperity.&nbsp;
Bonaparte did much for the city in the way of restoration.&nbsp;
In 1829 General La Fayette, that mild, well-meaning, but mistaken
man, came there to receive an ovation.&nbsp; Once more Lyons
throbbed with joy.&nbsp; But its troubles were not over.&nbsp; In
1831 the workmen rose in revolution, and the Duke of Orleans and
Marshal Soult had to come there to put it down.&nbsp; This was
followed by a disastrous inundation, and in 1849, and again in
1870, it was on the point of and was in connection with the
Commune of Paris, which had active agents there.&nbsp; The French
<i>ouvrier</i> is always discontented, and has no faith in God;
yet Lyons is still the second city of France, in spite of the
fact that not long since the President of the French Republic was
assassinated there.</p>

206</span>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">DIJON, OR THE WINE COUNTRY.</p>
<p>As an illustration of what a French provincial town is in the
way of hotels, I would take Dijon, where I stopped a night on my
way from Lyons to Paris.&nbsp; From Marseilles to Dijon the
country is interesting, giving fine views of the valley of the
Loire and hills and mountains far away.&nbsp; From thence to
Paris the ride is uninteresting.&nbsp; I suppose a great many
people stop at Dijon, as it abounds in magnificent hotels, all of
which seem to flourish.&nbsp; I put up at the H&ocirc;tel de
Jura, close to the railway-station, and I feel as proud as a lord
as I enjoy the luxury of that well-appointed hotel.&nbsp; My
bedroom is delicious, very unlike that of an English hotel.&nbsp;
Everyone in the house seems smiling and civil.&nbsp; The
dining-room is large and lofty, the cuisine is excellent, and the
smoking-room is elegantly furnished, as much so as a drawing-room
in England.&nbsp; I feel that I am in France, and that there they
manage better than they do with us.&nbsp; I go into the shop, and
the shopkeeper and his men all wear the blue blouse of the
country.&nbsp; If I buy anything, it is done up for me in the
most careful manner, and so profuse are the thanks of the
shopkeeper and his wife that I leave with a <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>feeling
that my visit has been a real benefit to the town.</p>
<p>There is much to see in Dijon; it is an ancient city, formerly
the capital of Burgundy, and still the headquarters of its
extensive wine trade.&nbsp; Let us hope that the dealers are
honest men, as burgundy is much in demand in my native
land.&nbsp; What I have at the hotel is excellent and cheap, and
this is the great difficulty in France in the way of any national
temperance movement.&nbsp; Like the Cape, like Australia, the
wine trade is an important factor in the national life.&nbsp; It
is the Diana of the Ephesians.&nbsp; Try to check it, and
everyone is up in arms.&nbsp; The traveller is bound to
drink.&nbsp; At lunch he has a quart bottle of red or white wine
placed before him, and it is just the same at dinner.&nbsp; The
wine is included in the bill, and it is all the same whether you
drink it or leave it alone.&nbsp; If there is a family dining or
lunching together, the bottle goes round, and perhaps a glass or
two will suffice; but a solitary traveller has his two quart
bottles to tackle per day, and what are you to do?&mdash;one is
afraid to drink water when travelling, as there may be poison in
the pot.&nbsp; A similar remark applies to milk.&nbsp; It is
sadly liable to infection, and it may be that, when you ask for
it, it may prove no exception to the general rule.&nbsp; I
remember how Sir Russell Reynolds, when on a Continental tour,
confined himself to milk, and on his return to England had a
serious illness in consequence.&nbsp; No wonder, then, that as a
rule the ordinary traveller sticks to the wine of the country,
which is little intoxicating, and has a pleasant favour that
helps much in its consumption.</p>
<p>I fancy the burgundy of Dijon is much purer and <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>pleasanter
than that of London.&nbsp; Nevertheless, two quarts of it a day
are rather too much.&nbsp; I got rid of the difficulty by
sacrificing my dinner and having tea instead.&nbsp; Dijon is a
very ancient city, and full of very interesting remains.&nbsp;
Indeed, I fancy it is one of the most interesting cities in
France.&nbsp; In an old engraving of it which I have, it is
surrounded by a wall, and seems a city of church spires, and its
ecclesiastical buildings are very old and numerous, but the walls
are gone, and handsome boulevards have taken their place.&nbsp;
Its modern fame depends on its wine, its spiced bread, and its
mustard.&nbsp; I buy a mustard-pot&mdash;a characteristic
specimen of French ingenuity.&nbsp; It is an earthenware
pig.&nbsp; The back is hollow.&nbsp; You take off the top, and
there is the place for the mustard and a long mustard-spoon, the
crooked end of which does duty as a tail.&nbsp; The animal has
his nose in a trough, which is divided into two portions, one for
pepper, the other for salt.&nbsp; I am proud of that mustard-pot,
and only use it on state occasions.&nbsp; At Avignon the
mustard-pot was equally a combination, but of a less artistic
character.&nbsp; It was simply a blue earthenware pot with the
mustard in the centre, while just below are two little recesses,
one for the pepper and one for the salt; and these you see at
really good hotels in preference to the costlier electroplate
mustard-pots in use nearer home.&nbsp; At Thetford they make
unbreakable earthenware.&nbsp; I should recommend the company to
try a few mustard-pots <i>&agrave; la Francaise</i>.</p>
<p>Dijon, says the guide-book&mdash;one of that excellent series
in red known as <i>Guide-Ioannes</i>, to be purchased for a
franc, sometimes less, at all French railway-stations&mdash;is
one of the most interesting cities in <a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>France, containing 63,425
inhabitants.&nbsp; It is situated at the junction of the Ouche
and the Suzon, at the foot of the mountains of the C&ocirc;te
d&rsquo;Or, and at the commencement of a fruitful valley which
stretches as far as the Jura.&nbsp; It is lovely&mdash;when I was
there it rained, and I did not see much of its
loveliness&mdash;well built and salubrious.&nbsp; Its principal
attractions are the Cathedral of St. Benigne, the Churches of
Notre Dame and St. Michel, and the Palace of the Dukes of
Burgundy, the Palace of Justice, the museum containing the tombs
of the Dukes of Burgundy and the remains of the Chartreuse de
Chamoi.&nbsp; Wherever you go you meet with old houses and
architecture of the most interesting character.&nbsp; It is a
place to be visited carefully by the artist.&nbsp; He will find
much to interest him at every step.&nbsp; In England we have
nothing like it.&nbsp; In the troubles and wars which led, after
many ages, to the establishment of a united France under one
monarch, Dijon became a place of great importance and the seat of
a legislative assembly.&nbsp; Originally a second-rate Roman
settlement, it had become Christianized by the preaching of St.
Benigne, who died a martyr for his faith, and to whom, as I have
already stated, the great cathedral was consecrated; yet it did
not become the seat of a bishopric till 1731.&nbsp; For ages the
Dukes of Burgundy resided there, and at a later time it gave to
France its grand pulpit orator, Bossuet, and to the Church St.
Bernard.&nbsp; In 1477 the French King gained possession of the
city, and the rule of the Dukes of Burgundy came to an end.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Lord of Craon,&rsquo; writes old Philip de
Commines&mdash;the father of modern history, whose memoirs,
writes Mr. Hallam, almost make an epoch in historical
literature&mdash;<a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>&lsquo;when he drew near Burgundy, sent forward the
Prince of Orange and others to Dijon to use persuasion and
require the people to render obedience to the King, and they
managed the matter so adroitly, principally by means of the
Prince of Orange, that the city of Dijon and all the other towns
in the duchy of Burgundy, together with many others in the
country, gave in their allegiance to the King.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Whether the people gained much by the change is not very
clear.&nbsp; Apparently, Commines did not think Dijon had much
cause for thankfulness.&nbsp; &lsquo;In my opinion,&rsquo; he
writes, &lsquo;of all the countries in the world with which I was
ever acquainted, the government is nowhere so well managed, the
people nowhere less obnoxious to violence and oppression, nor
their houses less liable to be destroyed by violence or
oppression, than in England, for these calamities only fall upon
the authors of them.&rsquo;&nbsp; I suppose the people of Dijon
were of a similar way of thinking, as the writer of the
guide-book tells us that &lsquo;<i>Dijon adopta avec enthousiasme
les principes de la R&eacute;volution</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Happily
its victims during that reign of terror were few.&nbsp; In the
war with France the Germans got hold of Dijon; but Garibaldi came
to the rescue.&nbsp; Now Dijon is at peace, and long may it so
remain, its hotels affording rest and refreshment to the weary
traveller, and its wine, when taken in moderation, making glad
the heart of man.&nbsp; Let me make one remark as a hint to the
tourist.&nbsp; Possibly he sees in the Continental Bradshaw an
advertisement of a hotel where the charges are rather less than
those of others.&nbsp; He goes there, but he finds no
reduction.&nbsp; The excuse is that the lower charge is not for
the hasty traveller, but for the one who comes to stay.</p>
<p><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>As a
recent writer in <i>Temple Bar</i> remarks, the general air of
pride and prosperity indicates that the capital of the duchy
thrives excellently as a member of the Republic.&nbsp; The Rue de
Libert&eacute; reminds us of some of our old English towns.&nbsp;
Step aside into any of the cross-streets, and you find yourself
in a labyrinth of crooked by-ways and carved doors, by the side
of low angular bell-towers, which seem to have come straight from
some old Flemish city, or you come to quaint, quiet, detached
squares, planted with young trees, with white detached houses all
round some of them, remnants of feudal hotels.&nbsp; In the Salle
des Gardes of the old palace the tombs of the two greatest Dukes
may still be seen.&nbsp; The palace, a huge, stately, modernized
building, is now a museum, a picture-gallery, and the
headquarters of all local and departmental business.&nbsp; It is
there that the French Protestants of to-day worship.&nbsp; The
Church of Notre Dame, of which the great Cond&eacute; declared
that it should be packed in a jeweller&rsquo;s box to preserve
it, is beautiful outside as in.&nbsp; It is the mother-church, to
which the Dijonais cling, where their children are baptized and
brought on their First Communion.&nbsp; It is crowded of a
Sunday.&nbsp; Nor is St. Michel externally less impressive; but
the interior is described as dowdy and disappointing.&nbsp; But,
after all, I fancy the chief visitors to Dijon are the
wine-merchants, and others interested in the wine trade.&nbsp;
The railway time-tables are full of familiar names of
vineyards.&nbsp; In a journey of thirty miles southwards, you
meet with, the well-known names of Chambertin, Vougeot, Beaune,
and Meursault, and you think, perhaps, of feasting and gaiety a
long time ago.&nbsp; But the country <a name="page212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>lacks the picturesque.&nbsp; You may
travel far on the main line without seeing anything in the shape
of pleasant landscape.&nbsp; The country around is undulating,
but on the whole flat.&nbsp; There are many walks with pleasant
memories&mdash;one leads to Talant, the ancient palace of the
Dukes of Burgundy, now the seat of an archaic village with a
marvellous church, where they show you an ancient picture said to
have been painted by St. Luke.&nbsp; From the common at the foot
of the hill you get a good view of Dijon, with the cathedral
towers in the foreground, and the cupola of St. Michel standing
up above.&nbsp; In an old ch&acirc;teau near-by was the
birthplace of the great St. Bernard.&nbsp; Far off is the rolling
expanse of land which stretches away to the frontiers of
Champagne.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was among these fields and
villages,&rsquo; says the writer in <i>Temple Bar</i> to whom I
have already referred, &lsquo;that the three battles of Dijon
were fought during the Franco-Prussian War, and here and there,
at turnings in the road and in wide ploughed land, monuments
covered with withered wreaths recall the event, and make the sad
landscape all the sadder; yet France pines for war, and the clang
of martial strains everywhere makes it little better than an
armed camp.&nbsp; It is the same everywhere.&nbsp; The one great
problem of European statesmen seems to be to find a sufficiency
of soldiers and sailors, as if we still lived in the dark ages,
when might was right, and the sole arbiter of nations was the
sword.&nbsp; It is awful to think of; it is a disgrace alike to
Christianity and civilization that such should be the case.&nbsp;
It is not now that we can sing, as we did in the great Exhibition
year, more than forty years ago, of the <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>triumph of
Captain Pen over Captain Sword.&nbsp; Still, we can pray with
Campbell:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The cause of truth and human weal,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O God above!<br />
Transfer it from the sword&rsquo;s appeal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Peace and Love.<br />
Peace, Love! the cherubim that join<br />
Their spread wings o&rsquo;er devotion&rsquo;s shrine;<br />
Prayers sound in vain, and temples shine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where they are not.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm">BOOKS OF REFERENCE.</p>
<p>As possibly some of my readers may wish for a further study of

<p>For invalids merely travelling for health, I would recommend
&lsquo;The Mediterranean Winter Resorts,&rsquo; by E. A. Reynolds
Ball, which is now in a third edition.&nbsp; Great prominence has
been given to the medical aspect of the principal invalid
resorts, and special articles dealing with the climatic,
sanitary, and general hygienic conditions of these resorts have
been contributed by resident English physicians.&nbsp; This is
the only English guide-book published containing authoritative
articles on the principal winter resorts by medical
experts.&nbsp; Another new feature which may be specially
mentioned is the introduction of detailed descriptions of the
newer health resorts, such as Biskra, Luxor, Helouan in North
Africa; St. Raphael, Grasse, Beaulieu, Ospedaletti on the
Riviera; Torre del Greco, Castellamare, Amalfi on the South
Italian Littoral, which have come into favour within the last few
years.&nbsp; In describing the different places in this
guide-book, a certain uniform order has, as far as possible, been
preserved in treating of the various subjects.&nbsp; Routes,
climatic conditions, society, hotel and villa accommodation,
amusements, sport, principal attractions, places <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>of
interest, and excursions, have been dealt with consecutively in
the above order, greater or less space being accorded to the
various subjects according to the special characteristics of each
resort.&nbsp; The author has attempted to give rather fuller
information about the newer and less known winter resorts,
concerning which little has been written in the standard works of
Murray and Baedeker, than he has done when describing the popular
and well-known Riviera resorts, which possess a whole library of
guide-book and travel literature of their own.</p>
<p>Dealing with the delicate question of hotel accommodation for
visitors, Mr. Reynolds Ball has not shrunk from the invidious
task of occasional recommendation, based either on personal
experience, or on trustworthy reports of friends or
residents.&nbsp; Most of the information in this handbook has
been derived at first-hand.&nbsp; He has visited nearly all the
places described, and with regard to others he has availed
himself of the help of travelled friends or residents possessing
knowledge gained on the spot.</p>
<p>Magazine articles in connection with the countries and cities
here referred to are numerous.&nbsp; Social life at Naples is
well described in an article in the <i>National Review</i> for
February, 1892.&nbsp; A readable account of the sanitary and
meteorological conditions of Cairo will be found in an article in
the <i>Lancet</i>, November, 1889, entitled &lsquo;The Winter
Climate of the Nile.&rsquo;&nbsp; An interesting description of
Corfu appeared in the <i>Sunday Magazine</i> for May, 1893, by
Professor Mahaffy; the reader will find also a good deal of
useful information in Cassell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Picturesque
Mediterranean,&rsquo; 1891.&nbsp; For Corsica the reader had
better refer to Mr. Freshfield&rsquo;s interesting <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>account of
climbing experiences in the island, which appeared in the
<i>Alpine Journal</i>, 1880.</p>
<p>When one thinks of the enormous number of works published in
connection with Egypt, it is worth noting that when Edward
William Lane wrote his account of the &lsquo;Manners and Customs
of Modern Egypt,&rsquo; of which an excellent reprint has been
published in the Minerva Library, when he returned to England
with a complete description of Egypt as it then was, and a
hundred excellent drawings, Egypt was not known or appreciated in
England, and no publisher would incur the expense of publishing
the work and reproducing the drawings, though they were
universally praised by all who saw them.&nbsp; In this respect
the change is simply marvellous.</p>

<h3>CRYING FOR THE LIGHT;<br />
Or, Fifty Years Ago.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">By J. EWING RITCHIE<br />
(<span class="smcap">christopher crayon</span>).</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>NOTICES OF THE PRESS</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the pressing social problems of the day he has much
to say that is well worth listening to.&nbsp; There is a force of
characterization in Mr. Ritchie&rsquo;s sketches and a passion
for human sympathy pervading his whole work.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>The
New Age</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A thoroughly interesting
romance.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Publishers&rsquo; Circular</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The story is refreshing and powerful, and the
characters well drawn and carefully studied.&nbsp; The heroine is
a charming, clever, and popular actress, and with commendable
courage the author endows her with a still higher
attribute&mdash;that of true, earnest Christianity.&nbsp;
Wentworth, preacher and journalist, is another attractive and
lifelike character.&nbsp; The scenes through which Mr. Ritchie
guides his characters are many and varied, and whether we take
him in his description of theatrical life, press life, in his
graphically depicted election scenes of fifty years ago, or in
the strong and painful realism of his &ldquo;low life,&rdquo; he
shows the same master hand.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Belfast Northern
Whig</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is much that is interesting, and may be read with
profit.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Weekly Times and Echo</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is interesting reading, and exhibits this popular
writer&rsquo;s facility and graphic
power.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Inquirer</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is quite refreshing to read Mr. Ritchie&rsquo;s new
book.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Bookseller</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Among the lower walks of journalism he treads upon
comparatively new ground, and this picture has the witness of
truth upon it.&nbsp; This, after all, is what we ask from the
novelist&mdash;a true picture of real
life.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Literary World</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Free from the suspicion of dulness&mdash;always
readable and often racy.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Eastern Daily Press</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is some bright writing in the
story.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Standard</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The style of the writer is bright and
sparkling.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Suffolk Chronicle</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One may tolerate the least popular views of an author
who writes so genially and
good-naturedly.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Scotsman</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A delightfully light and pleasant
work.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Sheffield Daily Telegraph</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is not a single page which does not bear the
stamp of Mr. Ritchie&rsquo;s widely read and acutely observant
mind.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Liverpool Daily Post</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The heroine is a charming woman&mdash;a clever actress
and a real Christian.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Christian World</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We shall rejoice to hear that the work has a large
circulation.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Christian Life</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Amongst the cleverest portions of the book is the
account of the Parliamentary election at Sloville&mdash;in which
the electioneering tactics of fifty years ago are unsparingly
exposed.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>East Anglian Daily Times</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Marked by a good deal of animation, and a vigorous and
wholesome tone.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Essex County Herald</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The work is in Mr. Ritchie&rsquo;s best
style.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Isle of Man Examiner</i>.</p>

<p>This Institution was founded in 1870 by the late Lady
Wolverton, for the purpose of receiving Orphan and Destitute
Boys, and by employing them in the houses of the gentry, in
domestic work, training them for indoor servants.</p>
<p>A boy must have passed the Fourth Government Standard of
Education, be twelve to fifteen years of age, and in good
health.&nbsp; The boys work in the morning, and attend school in
the afternoon.&nbsp; This is tested by yearly examinations, which
are presented to the Committee and published in their Report.</p>
<p>The entrance fee is &pound;5.&nbsp; As this is the only
payment asked during the period of three years or more that the
boy remains in the Society&mdash;indeed, started in life and
looked after for a period of years&mdash;&pound;5 thus expended
in helping a boy is an excellent investment.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;East Anglia&rdquo; has the merit of not being a
compilation, which is more than can be said of the great majority
of books produced in these days to satisfy the revived taste for
topographical gossip.&nbsp; Mr. Ritchie is a Suffolk
man&mdash;the son of a Nonconformist minister of Wrentham in that
county&mdash;and he looks back to the old neighbourhood and the
old times with an affection which is likely to communicate itself
to his readers.&nbsp; Altogether we can with confidence recommend
this book, not only to East Anglians, but to all readers who have
any affinity for works of its class.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Daily

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
